    NOTES:
    Another patch will follow this one shortly to add more 1.17 support, I am waiting on the Spigot API to test some stuff which isn't out yet.
    You shouldn't need to edit your configs for this update, your configs should update automatically.
    Expect some patches following this update for Axolotl and other new entities, waiting on the Spigot API to become available
    If you run into any issues with ViaVersion or ViaBackwards, use the latest dev builds for each.

Version 2.1.196
    Removed the explosion from Rupture
    Adjusted Rupture to play its particle effect less often
    Fixed a bug where Rupture never applied to additional targets during Serrated Strikes
    Fixed a bug where players without Rupture permission could use Rupture during Serrated Strikes
    Fixed a possible null error for our SelfListener
    Added locale string 'Swords.Combat.Rupture.Note.Update.One'
    Updated locale string 'Guides.Swords.Section.1'
    Crossbows can now be fished up with enchantments
    (API) Added McMMOEntityDamageByRuptureEvent (thanks qixils)

    NOTES:
    For now Rupture is non-lethal, I may add back a lethal component at the end of its damage
    Rupture will be in a state of change for a while as I receive feedback (give me feedback in Discord!)
    Crossbows is not in the default fishing loot list, you'd have to add it yourself.
    For Devs: McMMOEntityDamageByRuptureEvent extends EntityDamageByEntityEvent and uses CUSTOM type damage

Version 2.1.195
    Fixed a null connection error which affected some SQL users

Version 2.1.194
    Fixed an XP exploit
    Updated SQL to not throw errors if upgrades.yml was reset for any reason
    Updated SQL to use the newest driver path (and fall back to the old one if the new one doesn't exist on the server)
    Locale override files are now named locale_override.properties (converted automatically/generated automatically)
    Existing in use locale override files will be renamed to locale_override.properties and have some useful text put in them
    mcMMO will now generate a locale override file with some detailed instructions if one doesn't exist (will be found in /plugins/mcMMO/locales/locale_override.properties)

    NOTES:
    If you were overriding locale before this update mcMMO will just rename the existing override file to locale_override.properties add some useful text and then load it
    Remember you can use /mcreloadlocale to swap the edits in without restarting the server

Version 2.1.193
    Fixed another bug where mcrank/mctop/leaderboards weren't loading
    Fixed a bug where override locales weren't being loaded (but worked after a reloadlocale command)
    (Unit Tests) Added a test to make sure leaderboards for FlatFile were working
    Fixed blocks being dropped from blast mining even if yield was set to 0 (thanks Warriorrrr)

    (API) Added com.gmail.nossr50.api.ExperienceAPI.getOfflineXPRaw(org.bukkit.OfflinePlayer, java.lang.String)
    (API) Added com.gmail.nossr50.api.ExperienceAPI.getOfflineXPToNextLevel(org.bukkit.OfflinePlayer, java.lang.String)
    (API) Added com.gmail.nossr50.api.DatabaseAPI.doesPlayerExistInDB(java.lang.String)
    (Unit Tests) Added some more unit tests to FlatFileDB

Version 2.1.191
    Fixed a bug related to our blocktracker
    Fixed a bug that prevented the leaderboards from working on FlatFile in some circumstances
    Some minor optimizations to our Block events
    (Unit Tests) Added a test for initializing the leaderboard on FlatFile
Version 2.1.190
    Fixed a null error in BitSetChunkStore
Version 2.1.189
    Fixed a bug that would remove components from death messages when players were killed by mobs (thanks lexikiq)
    Rewrote how FlatFileDatabase verifies data integrity
    FlatFileDatabase has much better data validation and will repair broken/invalid data much better
    Fixed a bug where FlatFileDatabase users could have their names saved as "null" (names will be fixed the next time the player logs in)
    Added 20~ unit tests for FlatFileDatabaseManager (see notes)
    FlatFileDB now stores the last login of users again (was completely non functional for a while)
    Newly created flat file databases (mcmmo.users file) will have a comment line at the top noting the date the database was created
    Minor performance optimizations to FlatFile database
    mcMMO will once again purge old users if the config option is on (see notes)
    Fixed a bug where FlatFileDatabaseManager didn't properly upgrade older database entries to the newest schema
    The setting to disable the mcMMO user block tracker has been moved from our "hidden config" to persistent_data.yml
    Added 'mcMMO_Region_System.Enabled' to persistent_data.yml (don't touch this setting unless you know what you are doing)
    Removed MHD command (it didn't do anything for a while now)
    Removed UltraPermissions warning
    Updated pl locale (Thanks Mich3l3k)
    Fixed an IllegalPluginAccessException error that could happen during server shutdown
    Minor performance optimizations to misc parts of the codebase
    (API) Added com.gmail.nossr50.database.DatabaseManager.loadPlayerProfile(org.bukkit.OfflinePlayer)
    (API) Deprecated com.gmail.nossr50.database.DatabaseManager.loadPlayerProfile(java.util.UUID, java.lang.String)
    (API) Removed com.gmail.nossr50.database.DatabaseManager.newUser(java.lang.String, java.util.UUID)
    (API) PrimarySkillType will soon be just an enum with nothing special going on
    (API) Deprecated the members of PrimarySkillType use mcMMO::getSkillTools instead, deprecated members will be removed in Tridents & Crossbows (due soon)
    (API) Some members of PrimarySkillType were removed and not deprecated (such as the field constants)

    NOTES:
    I spent over 26 hours refactoring FlatFileDB and writing unit tests for it, this will ensure that any changes in the code that could break the database are caught at compile time (so long as we have enough tests, could probably use more)
    Regarding purging old users on the FlatFileDB, since this wasn't functioning for a while, the last login of users has been reset and if mcMMO hasn't seen that user since this update, it won't purge them as it has no way to know if they are truly an old user
    I'm likely going to add SQLite DB as an option in the future, I spent time to fix up the FlatFileDB as some Unit Testing practice.
    Ultra Permissions is SAFE to use with mcMMO, disregard previous messages stating otherwise
    After getting in contact with the UltraPermissions devs and exhaustive testing, I have concluded that using UltraPermissions is completely safe with mcMMO. The users who had an issue with performance currently have an unknown cause, potentially it is from a plugin using the UltraPermissions API I really can't say without more data. My apologies to the UltraPermissions team for reporting an issue between our two plugins directly, as that is not the case. I would have tested it myself sooner but UltraPermissions was closed source and premium so I wasn't particularly motivated to do so, however I have been given access to the binaries so now I can do all the testing I want if future issues ever arise which I have zero expectations that they will.

Version 2.1.188
    Updated default entries in treasures.yml to use "Level_Requirement" instead of "Drop_Level"
    Fixed a bug where excavation treasures only required level 0 instead of loading the value from the config
    Fixed a bug where /fishing was showing the wrong shake chance
    Default Shake chance increased from 15% to 30% (update advanced.yml manually or delete the file to regenerate it and receive these changes)
    Removed entries for ranks 2-8 of Shake from advanced.yml (Shake only has one rank, the extra entries were a mistake)
    Modified the warning about UltraPermissions
    Removed the debug message about potentially unused keys (only shown if you had debug mode enabled in config.yml)

    NOTES:
    This update makes changes to treasures.yml automatically to apply the fix, you don't need to do anything
    UltraPermissions devs are working on a fix for the performance issue bug

Version 2.1.187
    Fixed a ClassCastException error involving Rupture

Version 2.1.186
    Rupture has been reworked to solve a few outstanding issues (see notes)
    Fixed an exploit involving enchantments (thanks TheBusyBiscuit)
    Fixed a very small memory leak that would only happen in very rare situations
    Fixed a bug where XP wasn't granted while sneaking and interacting with a berry bush
    Gore no longer applies Rupture
    Gore no longer sends a message to the Wolf owner when it triggers
    Gore no longer sends a message to players that are hit by it
    Rupture no longer sends a message telling you that your target is bleeding
    Updated locale string 'Swords.SubSkill.Rupture.Description'
    Updated locale string 'Swords.SubSkill.Rupture.Stat.Extra'
    Updated locale string 'Swords.Combat.Rupture.Note'
    Added locale string 'Swords.SubSkill.Rupture.Stat.TickDamage'
    Added locale string 'Swords.SubSkill.Rupture.Stat.ExplosionDamage'
    Added 'Skills.Swords.Rupture.Rupture_Mechanics.Chance_To_Apply_On_Hit' to advanced.yml
    Added 'Skills.Swords.Rupture.Rupture_Mechanics.Duration_In_Seconds.Against_Players' to advanced.yml
    Added 'Skills.Swords.Rupture.Rupture_Mechanics.Duration_In_Seconds.Against_Mobs' to advanced.yml
    Added 'Skills.Swords.Rupture.Rupture_Mechanics.Tick_Interval_Damage.Against_Players' to advanced.yml
    Added 'Skills.Swords.Rupture.Rupture_Mechanics.Tick_Interval_Damage.Against_Mobs' to advanced.yml
    Added 'Skills.Swords.Rupture.Rupture_Mechanics.Explosion_Damage.Against_Players' to advanced.yml
    Added 'Skills.Swords.Rupture.Rupture_Mechanics.Explosion_Damage.Against_Mobs' to advanced.yml
    Removed 'Skills.Swords.Rupture.ChanceMax' from advanced.yml
    Removed 'Skills.Swords.Rupture.MaxBonusLevel.Standard' from advanced.yml
    Removed 'Skills.Swords.Rupture.MaxBonusLevel.RetroMode' from advanced.yml
    Removed 'Skills.Swords.Rupture.MaxTicks' from advanced.yml
    Removed 'Skills.Swords.Rupture.BaseTicks' from advanced.yml
    Removed 'Skills.Swords.Rupture.DamagePlayer' from advanced.yml
    Removed 'Skills.Swords.Rupture.DamageMobs' from advanced.yml

    NOTES:
    The old Rupture would constantly interfere with your ability to do a Sweep Attack/Swipe with swords, the new one solves this problem
    Targets will bleed and take "pure" damage while bleeding, this never kills the target. It will reduce them to 0.01 HP.
    After 5 seconds of not applying Rupture on the target Rupture explodes dealing a large amount of damage, this damage is not pure and is affected by armor etc.
    Rupture no longer tells you that you that you applied it to the target, it should be obvious from the sounds/particle effects
    The new Rupture no longer constantly interferes with the vanilla Swipe (the AOE attack built into Minecraft)
    The new Rupture has not had a fine tuned balance pass, I will be balancing it frequently after this patch, it may be too weak or too strong in its current form
    Rupture does not stack between players, whoever applied Rupture first determines its strength, this will change in the future (Stronger Ruptures will overwrite weaker ones)
    When you reapply rupture it immediately triggers a damage tick



Version 2.1.185
    Fixed an exploit for Herbalism

Version 2.1.184
    Removed April Fools event
    Fixed a bug where the default treasures.yml file had incorrect keys (see notes)

    NOTES:
    mcMMO will fix bad config files automatically, you don't need to do anything

Version 2.1.183
    Players now gain Acrobatics XP from falling even if they don't have the Roll permission node (checks for Acrobatics skill permission)
    treasures.yml now has separate settings for Drop_Level for Standard/Retro mode (see notes / this change is automatic)
    Updated Russian locale (thanks ImDaniX)
    Added Donkeys to beat lore (thanks QuantumToasted)
    Alchemy guide now correctly labels Rabbit's foot for potion of leaping (thanks mldriscoll)
    Fixed a bug where sweet berry bushes would give XP in situations where they shouldn't
    The /mmoinfo for Roll is removed for the time being, it will return in a future update (see notes)

    NOTES:
    Previously treasures.yml would take drop_level and multiply it by 10 if you were on Retro Mode, this is confusing so it has been changed
    treasures.yml will update old entries to follow the new format automatically, please review them to make sure they match expected values, and if not edit them and save then reboot your server
    Roll is actually the only skill that had an /mmoinfo, its one big mess, I'll fix it in the future

Version 2.1.182
    Players now receive XP from harvesting Sweet Berry bushes (double XP for harvesting fully grown berries)
    Fixed an error when using mcMMO with Featherboard that broke mcMMO skill boards when using certain commands
    Fixed a NPE with Scoreboards enabled when trying to update scoreboards
    Added 'Scoreboard.Recovery' locale key
    Sweet Berry Bush will no longer ready tools for Super Abilities
    You can now use '.all' (for example: mcmmo.perks.xp.customboost.all) to give an XP perk to all skills
    Removed hardcore and vampirism commands, these commands are dangerous, just modify the config file if you want to use hardcore / vampirism
    Fixed several errors in de locale (Thanks TheBusyBiscuit & w1tcherrr)
    Fixed a bug where double smelt never succeeded if the furnace was empty (but worked normally afterwards)
    Added some safety so that mcMMO automatic save interval is never more frequent than 1 minute
    Removed a few silent exceptions for scoreboards & mcMMO
    Added warning about UltraPermissions to mcMMO
    Fixed a potential NPE in McMMOPlayerExperienceEvent
    Added Sweet Berry Bush to config.yml bonus drops for Herbalism

    NOTES:
    Sweet Berry Bushes won't give double drops for now, looking into an elegant solution
    mcMMO will do a better job reporting if something went wrong with scoreboards, which may lead to improved plugin compatibility between mcMMO and other plugins touching scoreboards.

Version 2.1.181
    mcMMO no longer pointlessly tries to check for missing UUIDs for FlatFile database
    Removed the "name change detected" message as some plugins (such as Plan) invoke API calls which spams the console with this message
    Refactored code related to loading player data from the database
    (API) Added DatabaseManager::loadPlayerProfile(String)
    (API) Removed DatabaseManager::loadPlayerProfile(String, UUID, boolean)
    (API) Removed DatabaseManager::loadPlayerProfile(String, boolean)

Version 2.1.180
    mcMMO will now automatically remove corrupted data from mcmmo.users instead of catastrophic failure
    When using FlatFile database (the default) mcMMO will try its best to inform you which players had corrupted data when it does repairs
    Various minor optimizations and tweaks to the FlatFile database
    mcMMO is now much more verbose when things go wrong with the FlatFile database (removed some silent errors, added more error messages/warnings)
    mcMMO now uses UTF-8 compliant encoding for SQL databases (utf8mb4)
    Fixed a bug where mcMMO could in some circumstances fail to update SQL schema and mark it as successful
    Renamed updates.yml to updates_overhaul.yml to avoid some potential issues when upgrading from classic

    NOTES:
    This update was tested pretty thoroughly so it should be pretty safe, let me know if you have issues in the mcMMO discord or GitHub issues page for mcMMO!

Version 2.1.179
    Fixed a bug for FlatFile databases where some players with changed nicknames would have their levels not loaded upon login (possibly wiping their data)

    NOTES:
    Players affected by this bug (introduced in 2.1.177) may have their data lost, but this patch reverts the change which caused this bug.
    I suspect their data isn't lost and may be restored after this patch is loaded up, however if it is lost mcMMO makes regular backups so you can load one of those (check <Server Directory>/plugins/mcMMO/) or manually edit their levels via MMOEDIT as a solution of sorts.

Version 2.1.178
    Item replacement in vanilla fishing override back to SALMON from AIR (see notes)

    NOTES:
    Apparently can't set items to AIR, my bad. I'll look into another solution for fishing plugin compatibility soon.

Version 2.1.177
    Environmentally aware will now protect Wolves from Magma blocks
    Fixed a bug where mcMMO would fail to update a players name when it detected a name change
    mcMMO will treat vanished players as if they are offline when using the inspect command on them now (see notes)
    mcMMO now listens to PlayerFishEvent at HIGH event priority instead of HIGHEST
    Changed how vanilla fishing treasures are overridden (AIR instead of SALMON)
    (API) Added McMMOReplaceVanillaTreasureEvent -- see notes

    NOTES:
    A few changes were made to the inspect command, it used to reject you when used on vanished players, now it will be processed as if they are offline.
    Additionally if you do inspect a vanished player, it will not use their display name (consistent with offline players) as that would give them away for being online
    McMMOReplaceVanillaTreasureEvent is an event which is fired when mcMMO replaces a vanilla treasure with AIR if the server config file is set to override vanilla treasures, this causes some issues for other fishing plugins so this event helps those plugins be more compatible

Version 2.1.176
    Another fix for Double Smelt bringing item stack size to illegal values

Version 2.1.175
    Fixed a bug where mcMMO would occasionally give a 65 item stack from a double smelt on a furnace
    Fixed a bug where arrows could be duped when fired from a crossbow with piercing enchantment
    Added setting to enable or disable Green Thumb automatically replanting crops per crop to config.yml under 'Green_Thumb_Replanting_Crops' section
    Updated Adventure (our text dependency) fixes some errors when using color codes in party/admin chat (thanks TheBusyBiscuit)
    Added some support for negative Y values in anticipation of 1.17 world height changes (thanks t00thpick1)

Version 2.1.174
    Some legacy color codes in our locale file were swapped to &-code equivalents (thanks ViaSnake)
    Updated hu_HU locale (thanks andris155)
    Updated ru locale (thanks imDaniX)
    Updated fr locale (thanks Elikill58)
    (API) Added SubSkillBlockEvent for some SubSkill events that have a block (eg: Green Thumb Block events)
    (API) Green Thumb (Block) now fires a SubSkillBlockEvent which is cancellable
    (API) Green Thumb (Plant) now fires SubSkillBlockEvent which is cancellable
    (API) Shroom Thumb now fires a SubSkillBlockEvent which is cancellable

    NOTE: A lot of sub-skills without random chance elements are missing events, this will be cleaned up in the near future. If you need something specific added sooner than that, post a GitHub issue for it and I'll patch it in.
    I'm likely to separate Green Thumb into two distinct skills in an upcoming patch
    Only Green Thumb/Shroom Thumb trigger the new SubSkillBlockEvent for now

Version 2.1.173
    The experience orbs dropped by Knock on Wood rank 2 during Tree Feller are now much less frequent but provide more XP
    mcMMO no longer damages fishing rods or drains a player's hunger when fishing
    Fixed a visual bug where players who had lucky perk were shown incorrect odds when using skill commands (such as /axes)
    Updated ja_JP locale (thanks ViaSnake)
    Fixed a bug where scoreboards were torn down inappropriately when moving to or from blacklisted worlds (thanks steve4744)
    Updated Kyori's adventure library to 4.4.0 (used by mcMMO to handle text components)

Version 2.1.172
    Updated german locale (thanks TheBusyBiscuit)
    Added 'mcmmo.broadcast.levelup' permission node, if a player lacks this node they will not have their level up milestones broadcast to chat, this is a default permission node
    Power Levels are now included in level up broadcasts and they have their own settings (mirroring the existing settings for skill broadcasts)
    Added 'General.Level_Up_Chat_Broadcasts.Broadcast_Powerlevels' to config.yml
    Added 'General.Level_Up_Chat_Broadcasts.Broadcast_Powerlevels.Enabled' to config.yml
    Added 'General.Level_Up_Chat_Broadcasts.Broadcast_Powerlevels.Milestone_Interval' to config.yml
    Added 'General.Level_Up_Chat_Broadcasts.Broadcast_Powerlevels.Broadcast_Targets.Send_To_Console' to config.yml
    Added 'General.Level_Up_Chat_Broadcasts.Broadcast_Powerlevels.Broadcast_Targets.Only_Party_Members' to config.yml
    Added 'General.Level_Up_Chat_Broadcasts.Broadcast_Powerlevels.Broadcast_Targets.Only_Same_World' to config.yml
    Added 'General.Level_Up_Chat_Broadcasts.Broadcast_Powerlevels.Broadcast_Targets.Distance_Restrictions.Restrict_Distance' to config.yml
    Added 'General.Level_Up_Chat_Broadcasts.Broadcast_Powerlevels.Broadcast_Targets.Distance_Restrictions.Restricted_Radius' to config.yml
    Added 'Broadcasts.PowerLevelUpMilestone' to locale
    You can now disable the XP orbs from being dropped when Knock On Wood triggers during Tree Feller
    Added 'Skills.Woodcutting.TreeFeller.Knock_On_Wood.Add_XP_Orbs_To_Drops' to advanced.yml
    Changed Fists to not be capitalized (en_US) when lowering/readying berserk
    SkillActivationPerkEvent can now be called in async threads (thanks electronicboy)
    Removed a few never implemented settings from Skills.Woodcutting.TreeFeller in advanced.yml
    Updated bStats (thanks TheBusyBiscuit)
    Fixed some incorrect reporting to bStats (I'm so dyslexic...)

    NOTES:
    The new 'mcmmo.broadcast.levelup' node is a default node included under the 'mcmmo.defaults' node umbrella, you shouldn't have to give this to your players unless they don't have access to 'mcmmo.defaults'
    If you don't have a permission plugin you don't need to worry, players will have this node by default in that case
    There are situations where level up broadcasts will be skipped, for example if you go from level 0 -> 101 via addlevels or mmmoedit, and your broadcast interval is 100, it will be skipped as 101 falls out of this interval, this kind of skip only applies to command based leveling. Players gaining levels naturally should never have their broadcasts skipped. I'll fix this particular interaction in the future so that command based leveling never skips over milestone broadcasts, but for now it does.

Version 2.1.171
    Fixed a bug where arrows shot by infinite bow enchant would duplicate
    Fixed a bug where Archery XP would calculate incorrectly
    Axes can now replant cocoa plants (thanks Lyther)
    Players who level up at certain milestones have their level ups broadcast to the server (very configurable and optional, see notes)
    New locale string 'Broadcasts.LevelUpMilestone'
    Added 'General.Level_Up_Chat_Broadcasts.Enabled' to config.yml
    Added 'General.Level_Up_Chat_Broadcasts.Milestone_Interval' to config.yml
    Added 'General.Level_Up_Chat_Broadcasts.Broadcast_Targets.Send_To_Console' to config.yml
    Added 'General.Level_Up_Chat_Broadcasts.Broadcast_Targets.Only_Party_Members' to config.yml
    Added 'General.Level_Up_Chat_Broadcasts.Broadcast_Targets.Only_Same_World' to config.yml
    Added 'General.Level_Up_Chat_Broadcasts.Broadcast_Targets.Distance_Restrictions.Restrict_Distance' to config.yml
    Added 'General.Level_Up_Chat_Broadcasts.Broadcast_Targets.Distance_Restrictions.Restricted_Radius' to config.yml

    NOTES:
    The new broadcast system is very configurable, you could set the milestone interval to 1 if you want players to always be informed when someone levels up
    With default settings, messages are broadcast to all players on all worlds and to the server console when a player hits a level up that is a 100 interval, for example level 100, 300, 600, 2200 would all qualify
    You can change the settings to specify who receives these messages or turn the whole system off
    The message is customizable via locale: https://mcmmo.org/wiki/Locale
    There are comments in config.yml above each setting (as long as YAML doesn't move comments around chaotically...) that explain each setting
    In case your comments are missing, here's what they look like by default: https://gist.github.com/nossr50/baf656477c75663e9e2f9284acee8d67


Version 2.1.170
    Reverted a change that broke compatibility with the mcMMO papi ecloud thingy

Version 2.1.169
    Fixed a few memory leaks involving arrows
    Fixed mcMMO inappropriately assigning metadata to projectiles not fired from players
    Fix mctop not working if locale was set to something other than en_US
    mcMMO will now always emulate lure in order to stack it correctly and avoid vanilla bugs

Version 2.1.168
    Fixed an IndexOutOfBoundsException error when trying to access UserBlockTracker from an invalid range (thanks t00thpick1)
    (API) UserBlockTracker is now the interface by which our block-tracker will be known (thanks t00thpick1)
    Optimized memory access for Acrobatics fall anti-exploit mechanics (thanks t00thpick1)

Version 2.1.167
    Fixed a serious dupe bug
    Add McMMOPlayerPreXpGainEvent event for plugins to modify given exp (thanks electronicboy)
    Add SkillActivationPerkEvent (thanks electronicboy)

    NOTE:
    This bug was introduced in 2.1.165, update immediately if you are on 2.1.165 or 2.1.166

Version 2.1.166
    Fixed a small memory leak in the new COTW tracker
    Potentially fixed a ConcurrentModificationException involving the TransientEntityTracker (report this error if you encounter it)
    Music discs removed from the default fishing_treasures.yml
    Optimized how mcMMO saves player data (should improve timings on servers with bad disk speeds and or bad connectivity to their SQL server instance)

    NOTES:
    No one likes fishing up music discs, if you want this change it is recommended you delete fishing_treasures.yml and let it regenerate
    (You won't have this file if you haven't updated in a while, if so you don't need to do anything)
    If any of you encounter a ConcurrentModificationException error that mentions TransientEntityTracker in its stack trace after this update let me know, I have another fix in mind for this if this update didn't fix it.

Version 2.1.165
    Fixed a bug where Enchanted Books dropped by mcMMO (in Fishing) did not function correctly
    The mcMMO system which tracks player placed blocks has had some major rewrites (thanks t00thpick1)
    Optimized our ChunkUnloadEvent, this should improve timings in this area
    How mcMMO tracks COTW entities has been rewritten
    When COTW summons are killed players are now informed (from anything other than the time expiring).
    mcMMO will now be compatible with changes to world height (1.17 compatibility)
    mcMMO will ignore EntityPickupItemEvents from "Fake-Player" NPCs if it recognizes them as such, this will prevent some compatibility issues with some plugins
    SuperBreaker will now always activate if the target blocks fastest tool is a Pickaxe (used to require the block giving XP or being considered an ore)
    Master Angler mentions that it works better with a boat in its hover tip
    Added missing cooldown locale message 'Commands.Database.Cooldown'
    Added new locale message 'Taming.Summon.COTW.Removed'
    Updated locale entry 'Fishing.SubSkill.MasterAngler.Description'

    NOTES:
    Books dropped before this fix will not be usable and should just be chucked in lava, the broken books have blue names, the working books have yellow names.
    t00thpick1 has taken time to rewrite our block meta tracking system to be more efficient, easier to maintain, and support upcoming features such as world height changes
    This new system is compatible with the old one, it will convert old files to the new format as needed. You won't even know it is doing anything.
    This update shouldn't break anything as the API is the same.

    Alright back to work on T&C unless some major bugs come out of this...

Version 2.1.164
    mcMMO will now let players use vanilla blocks that have interactions (such as the vanilla Anvil) which are assigned as either Repair or Salvage blocks if a player is sneaking (see notes)
    The Rarity known as Records has been renamed to Mythic
    Fishing treasures have been moved from treasures.yml -> fishing_treasures.yml, copy over any custom entries you had from treasures.yml carefully as the config file has changed and you can't just copy paste your old entries without making a few edits
    Added Enchanted Books to fishing_treasures.yml as Legendary rarity (can drop with any legal enchantment - see notes)
    Added all Netherite gear to the Mythic rarity in fishing_treasures.yml
    Added Name Tag to fishing_treasures.yml as Rare rarity
    Added Netherite Scrap to fishing_treasures.yml as Legendary rarity
    Added Nautilus Shell to fishing_treasures.yml as Legendary rarity
    Music Disc rarity in fishing_tresures.yml has been broken up across tiers, they will be more common now.
    Mythic rarity (formerly known as Records) now allows for Enchantments to be applied to drops (See Notes)
    New exploit fix setting 'PreventPluginNPCInteraction' which defaults to true, when disabled it will allow combat interactions with "NPC" entities from plugins like Citizens
    ExploitFix.PreventPluginNPCInteraction Added to experience.yml
    Modified locale string 'Fishing.SubSkill.TreasureHunter.Stat.Extra' in existing locale files
    You can now define a whitelist of enchants or a blacklist of enchants for an Enchanted_Book entries in fishing_treasures.yml, see notes for an example

    NOTES:
    Before reading, Fishing/Excavation are getting a complete loot table rewrite in the future, everything changed in this patch is meant as a temporary quality of life fix until the bigger better change in the future.
    There's no real reason to allow for vanilla treasures anymore, so if you were using the vanilla treasure override I suggest turning it off.
    You can't add Enchanted_Book to any treasures outside of Fishing's treasure drops right now, I'll fix it in an upcoming patch. Well you can add it, but it won't work.
    The rarity formerly known as 'Records' was odd to me, if you got the best possible drop it was always going to be a Music Record drop (using the default mcMMO treasure list), and by default the Records tier had only music records. It was treated differently in the code as well, for example Records drops never had enchantments applied to them. So you could add say NETHERITE_ARMOR to them in your user config and it would never put enchantments on it, that seemed very odd to me.
    As a response to this, I've renamed Records as Mythic, I've moved the records into varying tiers, you'll start getting them much earlier now. I've also added Netherite and Enchanted Books to the Mythic tier.
    Enchanted Books have been added to Fishing loot, this is a basic hacky work around until the config update comes. Enchanted books can have any legal enchant and you can specify which Enchants a book can spawn with.
    Also the Enchantment chance to be applied to the book is completely equal across all enchantments, it does not follow the same logic as applying enchantments to fished up gear.

    Here is an example of using the whitelist or blacklist for an Enchanted_Book entry in fishing_treasures.yml
    https://gist.github.com/nossr50/4e15b8ba6915b5a5f516eccfba2d7169
    If you can't load this image, at the address of your treasure for example, at Fishing.Enchanted_Book.Enchantments_Blacklist: you define a list (which must follow yaml spec, google yaml linter) of enchants to disallow, likewise at Fishing.Enchanted_Book.Enchantments_Whitelist you can setup a whitelist, if neither is defined then the book can spawn with all possible enchants, if both are defined the whitelist is used instead of the blacklist
    Take care when moving any fishing entries you may have defined in treasures.yml over to fishing_treasures.yml, the config file has had a few things changed (as noted in these notes).

    When talking about NPCs in the below notes, I am referring to "Fake" Players used in plugins such as Citizens, not Villagers from Vanilla Minecraft or anything labeled NPC in another plugin which does not constitute a "Fake Player"
    Historically mcMMO has checked an entity for being a Fake-Player-NPC and backed out of any interaction, this was originally done because of Fake-Player-NPCs that were meant to be invincible/etc and not give XP
    However nowadays what a Fake-Player-NPC is used for is pretty loose, mcMMO only has definitions for some NPCs (such as from Citizens) it doesn't know about most Fake-Player-NPCs in most plugins unless they identify themselves in a similar way to the predefined parameters
    Leave this new exploit fix setting on true unless you understand the implications

    If you only ran mcMMO on your server you'd have no way to use Enchanted Books if you set the repair anvil to the vanilla anvil, so now you can sneak to open up its menu. By the way, mcMMO has the vanilla anvil as repair's default anvil (instead of iron block which it had been historically).
Version 2.1.163
    Fixed the translate URL pointing to the wrong place (thanks chew)
    Fixed a bug where FlatFile databases would always attempt a UUID conversion task every save operation (every 10 minutes) causing console spam
    mcMMO will no longer throw errors when incoming XP is below 0 (it will just silently cancel the operation)
    COTW Summoned entities are now removed when the chunk they are in is unloaded (prevents some exploits)

    NOTES:
    Seems I skipped releasing 2.1.162, not a big deal though as you should be using this version instead!
    I often test in SQL environments so I missed this bug, reminder to come bother me on discord if you find any annoying bugs!
    Also work on T&C is going great lately, I feel great. Perhaps my depression is getting better!

Version 2.1.162
    Fixed a bug where Alchemy brew events were processed after setting brew results (thanks Wolf2323)

Version 2.1.161
    Fixed a bug where a bunch of text from mcMMO was never being sent and or being sent as blank messages

    NOTES:
    Adventure (the chat library we use) had an update that required shading in another new module, but there were no errors thrown without running a jvm debug flag and testing it, which is why I missed it. I also missed it because I don't read update notes very closely
Version 2.1.160
    Fixed another 9+ year old exploit
    Silenced a harmless "error" related to Rupture/Bleed often produced when using mcMMO and crazy enchantments together

Version 2.1.159
    Fixed a memory leak involving renamed mobs
    Updated Adventure library (used in our chat code)

Version 2.1.158
    Fixed a bug where Lure level 4 and above would break fishing with the new Master Angler
    URLs in party/admin chat work again (use https:// in front to make links clickable)
    Updated nl locale (thanks xl3ehindTim)
    * Added Crossbow to string repairables (Thanks Momshroom)
    * Added Shield to wood repairables, with oak planks as material (Thanks Momshroom)
    * Added Elytra and Trident to Other repairables, using phantom membrane and prismarine crystals respectively. (Thanks Momshroom)

    NOTES:
    * You'll need to update repair.vanilla.yml yourself or delete the file and regenerate it (lazy easy way).
    Links in party/admin chat might not be clickable without https:// added in front of the url
    Added some stuff to Repair, a rework to Repair is coming in the future, this stuff will work for now as a placeholder.
    Master Angler will emulate the effects of Lure if the level is higher than 3 instead of attempting to stack with it to avoid a vanilla Minecraft bug where fish are never caught

Version 2.1.157
    Fixed a NPE that prevented mctop (Leaderboards) from working

Version 2.1.156
    Added Woodcutting skill 'Knock on Wood' - This ability gives you goodies (saplings, xp orbs, apples, etc) when using Tree Feller
    Tree Feller no longer gives non-wood items by default, it now requires Knock on Wood for additional loot
    When you raise your axe you will now see information about any super abilities on CD
    Fixed a bug where Green Thumb would replant blocks floating in the air
    Fixed a bug where the admin and party chat toggles in chat.yml didn't function as intended
    * Fixed a bug where Master Angler rank 1 level requirement was set too high (default configs)
    Added some errors that trigger if a plugin hooking into mcMMO is grabbing leaderboards for child skills through our SQL/FlatFile class (which don't exist)
    mcMMO will automatically fix some errors in logic for user settings in skillranks.yml
    Corrected some logic errors when checking for oddities in skillranks.yml
    Removed incorrect translations of Master Angler from various locales
    Modified Master Angler stat lines in /fishing
    Updated Green Thumb description to mention that it needs a hoe
    'Abilities.Limits.Tree_Feller_Threshold' in config.yml now defaults to 1000 instead of 500 (edit your config)
    Added new permission node 'mcmmo.ability.woodcutting.knockonwood'
    Added new locale line 'Woodcutting.SubSkill.KnockOnWood.Name'
    Added new locale line 'Woodcutting.SubSkill.KnockOnWood.Stat'
    Added new locale line 'Woodcutting.SubSkill.KnockOnWood.Description'
    Added new locale line 'Woodcutting.SubSkill.KnockOnWood.Loot.Normal'
    Added new locale line 'Woodcutting.SubSkill.KnockOnWood.Loot.Rank2'

    NOTES:
    You don't need to touch your config files unless you want to get the new tree feller threshold (1000 instead of 500), you could also delete config.yml and regenerate it, for all the other config changes in this update, they are handled automagically.
    * - If you haven't manually edited your Master Angler entries in skillranks.yml then the previous mcMMO update has rank 1 for Master Angler too high, this update automatically fixes it.
    You may have noticed sometimes config file entries are in a strange jumbled order, yeah that's "normal". We'll be moving to HOCON for the config update and wont' have to deal with this crap for much longer.
    I'll probably be doing a bunch of tweaks to mcMMO UI in the near future, I don't know, or I'll work on T&C

Version 2.1.155
    Master Angler now has 8 ranks
    Master Angler is now supported by the latest builds of Spigot on 1.16.4
    Wolves will now earn a lot more XP from combat than before (Wolves are going to be tweaked a lot in the near future)
    Fixed a bug where Spectral Arrow awarded too much XP
    Fixed a bug where party members other than the party leader had names that weren't properly hex colored
    Added 'Skills.Fishing.MasterAngler.Tick_Reduction_Per_Rank.Min_Wait' to advanced.yml
    Added 'Skills.Fishing.MasterAngler.Tick_Reduction_Per_Rank.Max_Wait' to advanced.yml
    Added 'Skills.Fishing.MasterAngler.Boat_Tick_Reduction.Max_Wait' to advanced.yml
    Added 'Skills.Fishing.MasterAngler.Boat_Tick_Reduction.Min_Wait' to advanced.yml
    Added 'Skills.Fishing.MasterAngler.Tick_Reduction_Caps.Min_Wait' to advanced.yml
    Added 'Skills.Fishing.MasterAngler.Tick_Reduction_Caps.Max_Wait' to advanced.yml
    Removed Skills.Fishing.MasterAngler.BoatModifier from advanced.yml
    Removed Skills.Fishing.MasterAngler.BoatModifier from advanced.yml
    Optimized party/admin chat a bit
    Added some misc safeguards against possible NPEs
    Added some debug output when fishing if mmodebug is on
    (API) Removed AbstractPlayerAuthor#getComponentDisplayName
    (API) Removed AbstractPlayerAuthor#getComponentUserName
    (API) Removed Author#getAuthoredComponentName

    NOTES:
    Master Angler won't work if you aren't on 1.16.4, the truth is it hasn't worked for a very long time (Since before 1.13.2)
    The Spigot API related to it has been broken since years and years ago, and they finally updated the API but it is only in the newest builds of Spigot.
    If you are on something that doesn't support the new Master Angler that skill will be missing when you type /fishing
    The boat bonus for master angler is static and doesn't improve when leveling master angler.
    All the new master angler stuff is configurable and can be found in advanced.yml
    The configurable reduction tick stuff for master angler is multiplied by the rank level when determining the final bonus (use /mmodebug when fishing to see some details)
    Master Angler stacks with the Lure enchant
    Removed some unnecessary API, we aren't a chat plugin so these things shouldn't be here.
    Slowly adding Nullability annotations to the codebase

Version 2.1.154
    Hex colors are now supported in Party & Admin chat
    Added support for &#RRGGBB color codes (hex colors) in chat and nicknames for party and admin chat
    Added hex colored nickname support to admin/party chat
    Fixed a bug where Tree Feller was not dropping some items like saplings
    Fixed a bug where using admin chat would in some circumstances throw a NPE
    (API) Author class has been reworked
    (API) McMMOChatEvent::getSender removed (use getDisplayName() instead)
    (API) McMMMOChatEvent::setDisplayName() removed
    (API) Removed Author::setName use Player::SetDisplayName instead
    (API) Modified Author::getAuthoredName signature to -> Author::getAuthoredName(ChatChannel)
    (API) Added Author::getAuthoredComponentName(ChatChannel)
    (API) PartyAuthor and AdminAuthor removed, replaced by PlayerAuthor
    (API) Probably some more undocumented changes that I'm forgetting...

Notes:
    For example '/p &#ccFF33hi guys' will send a message colored in hex colors
    You'll see ~§x in console when hex color codes are used, this is a quirk of how the 'adventure' library we are using is handling some bungee component related things, so it's outside of my hands for now

Version 2.1.153
    Fixed a bug where most sub-skills were not being displayed when using a skills command (for example /taming)
    Fixed a bug where some URL links were not being colored
    Updated fr locale (thanks Vlammar)

Version 2.1.152
    Fixed a bug where Tree Feller would sometimes double drop blocks inappropriately
    Fixed a bug with bleed damage calculations and player armor
    Added some code to prevent a possible NPE when spawning items in a world that got unloaded
    Added the missing 'pc' alias for party chat
    Added the missing 'ac' alias for admin chat
    (API) New ENUM ItemSpawnReason which gives context for why mcMMO is dropping an item
    (API) McMMOItemSpawnEvent::getItemSpawnReason() was added
    (API) Many instances of spawning items that didn't used to create and call an McMMOItemSpawnEvent now do
    Updated hu_HU locale (thanks andris)

    NOTES:
    I really should stop letting my OCD compel me to rewrite code all the time.
    Bleed was meant to do reduced damage to players wearing 4 pieces of armor or more, it was incorrectly counting everyone as wearing 4 pieces even when they weren't.
    This means Bleed was doing a bit less damage than was intended against players without a full set of armor equipped.

Version 2.1.151
    Added new config for chat options named 'chat.yml'
    Added 'Chat.Channels.Party.Spies.Automatically_Enable_Spying' to chat.yml which when enabled will start users who have the chat spy permission in chat spying mode
    All chat settings that used to be in 'config.yml' are now in 'chat.yml'
    The list of party members shown when using the party command has been simplified, this will change again in the T&C update
    Fixed a bug where players could use the party chat command without the party chat permission
    Party Leaders now use a different style when chatting than normal party members (can be customized)
    Added 'Chat.Style.Party.Leader' to the locale, party leaders use this as their chat style

    NOTES:
    I greatly disliked the old party member list but was avoiding rewriting it until later, someone pointed out how ugly it was and my OCD triggered and now it is rewritten. I will rewrite it again in Tridents & Crossbows.
    The new config file lets you disable the chat system (you can disable all of it, or just party chat, and or just admin chat) without permission nodes.
    If you disable the party/admin chat, then the party/admin chat command never gets registered and attempting to use the command will result in a whole lot of nothing, so if you want users to have a permission denied message then just stick to negating permission nodes.
    I'll probably be tweaking mcMMO visually a lot in the near future, probably after Tridents & Crossbows goes out.
    I hate adding more config files using the old .yml system, but the config update is a ways out and this works for now.
    Reminder that the look/feel of party/admin chat is now determined by locale entries
    https://mcmmo.org/wiki/Locale can help you understand how to change the locale

Version 2.1.150
    Fixed an ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception when using /skillreset
    You can now add "-s" at the end of mmoedit, addlevels, or addxp to silence the command. Which will prevent the target of the command from being informed that the command was executed.
    mcMMO should now be compatible with 1.16.4's new social features (affects Party/Admin chat)
    mcMMO Party & Admin Chat have had a complete rewrite
    Players & Console can now use color codes (including stuff like &a or [[GREEN]]) in party or admin chat
    Added new permission node 'mcmmo.chat.colors' which allows players to use color codes, negate to disallow this
    The style and look of admin/party chat is now determined by locale file instead of options in config.yml
    The default style of admin/party chat has been updated, and it may be updated again in the future
    Improved messages players receive when they toggle on or off admin or party chat
    All locale files have had 99.9% of their [[]] color codes replaced by & color codes, you can still use [[GOLD]] and stuff if you want
    Added new locale entry 'Commands.Usage.3.XP'
    Added new locale entry 'Chat.Identity.Console'
    Added new locale entry 'Chat.Style.Admin'
    Added new locale entry 'Chat.Style.Party'
    Added new locale entry 'Chat.Spy.Party'
    Added new locale entry 'Chat.Channel.On'
    Added new locale entry 'Chat.Channel.Off'
    (API) ChatAPI::getPartyChatManager() has been removed
    (API) ChatAPI::sendPartyChat has been removed (similar functionality can be found in the new ChatManager class)
    (API) ChatAPI::sendAdminChat has been removed (similar functionality can be found in the new ChatManager class)
    (API) Fake events in mcMMO now implement 'FakeEvent' (thanks TheBusyBiscuit)
    (API) Updated Adventure Library to 4.1.1
    (API) McMMOChatEvent has been reworked, plugins dependent on this event should review this class and make appropriate changes

    NOTES:
    The yet to be released Tridents & Crossbows update will also feature some new features related to party chat, so expect more tweaks to those features in the future.
    I actually spent a little over a week on this, the old code for party/admin chat was absolutely horrid and when porting in the new 1.16.4 features I couldn't stand the sight of it so I burned everything to the ground and rewrote all of it.
    The mcMMO chat events now make use of adventure library by Kyori, you can override the message payload with a TextComponent, which allows for some fancy stuff potentially.
    I'll put in some of my own fancy stuff for party and admin chat in a future update.

Version 2.1.149
    Added a new config file 'persistent_data.yml'
    Almost all persistent mob data is now off by default and needs to be turned on in persistent_data.yml (new config file) for performance concerns

NOTES:
There are some performance issues with how Spigot/MC saves NBT when you start adding NBT to mobs, because of this I have decided that the new persistent data from 2.1.148 is now opt-in.

Not every server will suffer a TPS hit when using the persistent data options, but there is a significant IO cost which can affect TPS if you have them on

I am therefore making many persistent options (the problematic ones involving mobs) opt-in so only those aware of the performance risk will be using the feature.

Persistent data on mobs was a new feature that was introduced in 2.1.148, it was not in mcMMO for the last 10 years and most of you probably didn't even know that it was missing

An example of persistent data would be, normally mcMMO would give 0 XP for a mob from a mob spawner, in the last 10 years if the server rebooted then those existing mobs would give XP again. But with the persistent data option turned on in persistentdata.yml they will be saved to disk, and mcMMO will not forget about them upon reboot.

For now it is not recommended to use persistent data without monitoring performance of ticks afterwards to make sure it was something your server could handle.

I have a solution in mind to make persistent data not so expensive, but writing the code for that will take some time. This will serve as an interim fix.

I am going to focus on Tridents & Crossbows instead of that alternative solution, so don't expect it anytime soon. Use persistent data only if you understand the potential performance cost risk.
@
Version 2.1.148
    Fixed a memory leak involving entity metadata
    Alchemy progression is now more reasonable (delete skillranks.yml or edit it yourself to receive the change, see notes)
    Made some optimizations to combat processing
    New experience multiplier labeled 'Eggs' in experience.yml with a default value of 0 (previously mobs from eggs were using the Mobspawner experience multiplier)
    New experience multiplier labeled 'Nether_Portal' in experience.yml with a default value of 0
    New experience multiplier labeled 'Player_Tamed' in experience.yml with a default value of 0
    New advanced.yml config setting 'Skills.Mining.SuperBreaker.AllowTripleDrops' defaults to true

    Fixed a bug where mobs from eggs were only tracked if it was dispensed (egg tracking now tracks from egg items as well)
    Fixed a bug where egg spawned mobs were sometimes not marked as being from an egg (used in experience multipliers)
    Fixed a bug where entities transformed by a single event (such as lightning) weren't tracked properly if there was more than one entity involved
    mmodebug now prints out some information about final damage when attacking an entity in certain circumstances

    (1.14+ required)
        Mobs spawned from mob spawners are tracked persistently and are no longer forgotten about after a restart
        Tamed mobs are tracked persistently and are no longer forgotten about after a restart
        Egg spawned mobs are tracked persistently and are no longer forgotten about after a restart
        Nether Portal spawned mobs are tracked persistently and are no longer forgotten about after a restart
        Endermen who target endermite are tracked persistently and are no longer forgotten about after a restart
        COTW spawned mobs are tracked persistently and are no longer forgotten about after a restart
        Player bred mobs are tracked persistently and are no longer forgotten about after a restart
        Player tamed mobs are tracked persistently and are no longer forgotten about after a restart

    NOTES:
    Egg mobs & Nether portal pigs being assigned to the mobspawner xp multiplier didn't make sense to me, so it has been changed. They have their own XP multipliers now.
    While working on making data persistent I stumbled upon some alarming memory leak candidates, one of them was 7 years old. Sigh.
    Alchemy now progresses much smoother, with rank 2 no longer unlocking right away. Thanks to Momshroom for pointing out this oddity. Delete skillranks.yml or edit it yourself to recieve this change.
    https://gist.github.com/nossr50/4c8efc980314781a960a3bdd7bb34f0d This link shows the new Alchemy progression in skillranks.yml feel free to copy paste (or just delete the file and regenerate it)
    There's no persistent API for entities in Spigot for 1.13.2, but in the future I'll wire up NMS and write it to NBT myself.
    This means the new persistence stuff requires 1.14.0 or higher, if you're still on 1.13.2 for now that stuff will behave like it always did

Version 2.1.147
    Fixed a bug where players below the level threshold on a hardcore mode enabled server would gain levels on death in certain circumstances

Version 2.1.146
    A bug where players would disconnect from mcMMO messages has been fixed (thanks kashike / read notes)
        It should be noted this was NOT an mcMMO bug, but a bug within Spigot since Spigot 1.16
    A dupe exploit has been fixed
    Improvements were made to tracking player placed blocks in mcMMO
    Players no longer lose levels below the level threshold in hardcore mode
    Hardcore now only applies penalties to levels above threshold

    NOTES:
    Shout out to Kashike
    Kashike is a developer on the mcMMO team, however after I recruited him had a lot of life stuff come at him and has./tn't had a chance to contribute until now!

    JSON is used by Minecraft for a lot of stuff, in this case the JSON mcMMO made use of was related to displaying text in chat or displaying text on the clients screen in other places such as the action bar, there's been a bad bug in Spigot since 1.16 that would disconnect players some of the time when sending JSON components.
    mcMMO makes heavy use of these components, so since spigot has yet to fix the bug I decided we needed a work around for the time being.
    The library named 'adventure' is developed by the Kyori organization, which is Kashike's baby.
    Kashike is a very talented and skilled developer and he did the work on this patch to solve this issue.

    This is a link to an bug report I did on this bug on Spigot's issue tracker, it is my understanding they have yet to find a way to reliably reproduce this bug.
    If you have any information please post about it in this thread.

    https://hub.spigotmc.org/jira/browse/SPIGOT-6056
    Although mcMMO solved this issue by switching to Kyori's Adventure library for sending JSON Components, most Spigot plugins have not implemented a work around like this and will continue to make players disconnect until it is solved within Spigot.

    Hardcore changes
    If you set a level threshold of 100 and player with 150 levels dies, they should never lose more than 50 levels as the first 100 are considered part of the threshold.
    Prior to this change in this exact same scenario a player could be penalized and be put below the threshold.

    Shout out to HexedHero for reporting the dupe exploit and providing a demonstration of how to replicate it

    Tridents & Crossbows update
    It is still being worked on but it won't make a September release.
    October is the new target release but I am terrible with estimates so take it with a grain of salt!


Version 2.1.145
    Reverted 'Changed one of the PlayerInteractEvent listeners to ignore cancelled events' from 2.1.144


Version 2.1.144
    Steel Arm Style damage is now customizable in advanced.yml (make sure to set override to true)
    Fixed a bug where Deflect worked against non-arrow projectiles
    Fixed a bug where Deflect was checked twice, resulting in two chances to deflect effectively
    Fixed a bug where Roll wouldn't award XP when fall height was over a certain amount
    Lowered the XP ceiling of Roll
    Fixed a NPE that would happen involving taming in combat processing
    Updated hu_HU locale (thanks andris155)
    Fixed a bug where mcMMO could erase item data on Wheat Seeds when using Green Thumb on a block
    Changed one of the PlayerInteractEvent listeners to ignore cancelled events (should improve plugin compatibility)
    mmodebug mode now prints some information when fuel efficiency is applied to a furnace

    NOTES:
    I seem to consistently find old bugs in mcMMO, this deflect bug where it was checked twice, who knows how many years its been in mcMMO, I didn't check but its probably between 5-7.
    I was waiting to make Steel Arm Customizable for the config update (due in the future), but enough people ask for it that I decided to do the extra work to put it into 2.1.XX
    Tridents & Crossbows is likely going to be in development continuing into September, I am taking my time to make it feature packed and I hope you guys will appreciate it.

Version 2.1.143
    mcMMO now tracks super ability boosted items through persistent metadata
    mcMMO no longer relies on lore to tell if an item has been modified by a super ability
    Slight buff to Rupture (1 more tick duration across all ranks)
    Lore no longer gets added to items being buffed by mcMMO./

    NOTES:
        The item tracking is persistent for MC versions 1.13-1.16.2 (and beyond). However the code handling the persistence for 1.13.2 differs from the other versions. It shouldn't result in any problems.
        Any items that currently have the old "mcMMO Ability Tool" lore on them will have that lore stripped off them and will have any dig speed enchants removed. This should only affect glitched items that never properly got their buffs removed.

Version 2.1.142
    Iron Arm Style renamed to Steel Arm Style
    Steel Arm Style now scales over 20 ranks instead of 5
    Added 'mcmmo.ability.unarmed.steelarmstyle' permission node
    Removed 'mcmmo.ability.unarmed.ironarmstyle' permission node
    Added locale entry 'Unarmed.SubSkill.SteelArmStyle.Name'
    Added locale entry 'Unarmed.SubSkill.SteelArmStyle.Description'
    Updated locale entry 'Unarmed.Ability.Bonus.0'

Version 2.1.141
    Added some missing values for 1.16.2 compatibility modes

Version 2.1.140
    Fixed a few potential issues with scoreboards
    Updated polish locale

    NOTES:
    Scoreboards code in mcMMO is pretty messy and poorly designed, I am going to rewrite it in a future update. The fixes applied in this patch should solve some problems some users were having for now.

Version 2.1.139
    Code used to fetch UUIDs was reworked to avoid a scenario where it failed (thanks t00thpick1)
    Added 'Netherite_Gold_Ore' to Smelting XP tables (thanks Quavelen)
    Added 'Gilded_Blackstone' and 'Nether_Gold_Ore' to code used to determine what can activate Super Breaker in certain situations (thanks Quavelen)
    MMOinfo for Roll was corrected (thanks emanondev)

Version 2.1.138
    Fixed a bug where Netherite weapons/tools/armor weren't applying correct values in some skill calculations

Version 2.1.137
    Added some code to avoid NPE errors when checking armor on entities

Version 2.1.136
    Furnace ownership is no longer lost when the furnace stops doing a job
    Furnaces remember owners between restarts (requires MC 1.14 or higher)

    NOTES:
        I'm making use of a Spigot API for persistent data for versions of MC 1.14 and above, for versions below the data will be temporary as it has been up until this point.
        In the future I'll wire up NMS to make use of NBT and all versions will have persistent data support.

Version 2.1.135
    Furnaces no longer simulate block break checks when assigning ownership as it caused some unwanted plugin conflicts
    Fixed an issue where Fishing would break if exploit protection was turned off for Fishing (Thanks Ineusia)
    Fixed Super abilities not being translated on scoreboards (Thanks Ineusia)
    Added option in advanced.yml to squelch ability activation messages being sent to other players via action bar (Thanks Ineusia)

Version 2.1.134
    Furnaces now change ownership to the last player who clicks in their inventory and is legally allowed to break the furnace
    Smelting now has a Bonus Drops section in config.yml
    Smelting now only doubles smelting results for items which have bonus drop entries in config.yml
    Smelting XP can now be gained offline, but all other benefits from Smelting don't happen unless you're online
    Fix brewing stand not consuming items (thanks Durburz)
    Changed the UUID updater task to not catastrophically fail when requests failed
    Fixed a bug where players could set each other on fire when partied or when PVP was disabled
    Fixed a NPE that could happen with thrown potions
    Fixed a potential NPE when damaging player armor with Axes
    Fixed a potential NPE when damaging a player with Blast Mining
    Fixed a potential NPE when checking tools related to Super Abilities
    Fixed a potential NPE when checking the Chimaera Wing
    Fixed a potential NPE when creating party member lists
    Fixed a potential NPE when fishing
    Fixed a potential NPE when players right click blocks
    Fixed a locale mistake in locale hu_HU
    Fixed a locale mistake in locale ru
    Minor code cleanup

    NOTES:
    It used to be that Furnaces would assign an owner and that would be their owner until the server shutdown, now owners will change based on who last had their hands on the furnace.
    You won't become the owner if you are not allowed to view the inventory of a furnace, or break the furnace, or interact with the contents of the furnace

Version 2.1.133
    A fix for an 'array out of bounds' error related to players clicking outside the inventory windows has been fixed
    French locale has been updated (thanks Elikill58)
    Another fix has been deployed to prevent mobs from having hearts in player death messages (thanks FrankHeijden)
    Players no longer ready their tool if they don't have access to the skill (thanks Draycia)
    Unused NMS compatibility layers have been disabled for now (expect them to be used in the future for 1.12/1.8 support stuff)

Version 2.1.132
    A fix is in place to prevent an exploit from working that is due to a yet to be patched Spigot server software bug
    Fixed a NPE that could happen when players swapped items from their hotbar

    NOTE: The exploit was not described on purpose, please update.
    I reported the bug to Spigot, so hopefully it will be patched in the near future.

Version 2.1.131

    New permission node 'mcmmo.ability.repair.netheriterepair' which is included in the mcmmo.defaults permission package
    New permission node 'mcmmo.ability.salvage.netheritesalvage' which is included in the mcmmo.defaults permission package
    Changed Salvage maximum quantity values to 4 for all Netherite armor
    mcMMO will set the default salvage quantities for netherite armor to 4 once and then never again (see notes)

    Added Basalt to Bonus Drops for Mining in config.yml (see notes)
    Added Polished Basalt to Bonus Drops for Mining in config.yml (see notes)
    Added Blackstone to Bonus Drops for Mining in config.yml (see notes)
    Added Chain to Bonus Drops for Mining in config.yml (see notes)
    Added Nether Bricks to Bonus Drops for Mining in config.yml (see notes)
    Added Red Nether Bricks to Bonus Drops for Mining in config.yml (see notes)

    Added Shroomlight to Bonus Drops for Herbalism in config.yml (see notes)
    Added Twisting Vines to Bonus Drops for Herbalism in config.yml (see notes)
    Added Nether Wart Block to Bonus Drops for Herbalism in config.yml (see notes)
    Added Warped Wart Block to Bonus Drops for Herbalism in config.yml (see notes)
    Added Weeping Vines to Bonus Drops for Herbalism in config.yml (see notes)
    Added Crimson Hyphae to Bonus Drops for Woodcutting in config.yml (see notes)
    Added Stripped Crimson Hyphae to Bonus Drops for Woodcutting in config.yml (see notes)
    Added Warped Hyphae to Bonus Drops for Woodcutting in config.yml (see notes)
    Added Stripped Warped Hyphae to Bonus Drops for Woodcutting in config.yml (see notes)

    Added Red Nether Bricks to Experience tables for Mining in experience.yml (see notes)
    Added Netherite to Experience tables for Repair in experience.yml (see notes)
    Added Piglin Brute to Experience tables for all combat skills in experience.yml

    Netherite now requires 100 Salvage skill (by default configs) in order to salvage
    Added the missing NMS wiring (it should be noted NMS isn't currently being used in mcMMO, but the framework is there. Working on a sideproject involving this...)

    NOTES:

    You should not need to edit your configs to receive any changes in this patch, simply starting your server is enough.
    Default salvage quantities for netherite armor were above 4 in some cases which was not intended, mcMMO will run some code to correct this once and then it will not edit the file again.
    Repair and Salvage are going to get some tweaks regarding Netherite gear really soon.
    This update adds quite a few missing entries for bonus drops, without these entries double drops on these items/blocks will not happen.


Version 2.1.130
    Fixed a bug that prevented Repair from working on the new Netherite weapons/armors
    Fixed a bug where Netherite gear used Gold Ingots to repair instead of Netherite Scraps (by default)
    mcMMO will now run a script to fix a misspelling of netherite in repair/salvage configs (script only runs once and then never again)
    mcMMO will produce a fake PlayerItemDamageEvent before damaging axes in Tree Feller execution


    NOTES:
    Early versions of 1.16 support had Netherite misspelled, the script I added executes before loading those config files to fix the spelling mistakes if it finds any
    If you are still having issues with Repair/Salvage, delete the repair and salvage .yml files in /plugins/mcMMO and restart the server

Version 2.1.129
    Added new subcommand /mmoxpbar disable - Hides all mcMMO XP bars
    New locale string 'Commands.XPBar.DisableAll'
    Added Blackstone to Mining experience tables
    Added Chain to Mining experience tables
    Added Bone Block to Mining experience tables
    Added Cracked Nether Bricks to Mining experience tables
    Added Chiseled Nether Bricks to Mining experience tables
    Added Crying Obsidian to Mining experience tables
    Added Gilded Blackstone to Mining experience tables
    Added Crimson Hyphae to Woodcutting experience tables
    Added Stripped Crimson Hyphae to Woodcutting experience tables
    Added Warped Hyphae to Woodcutting experience tables
    Added Stripped Warped Hyphae to Woodcutting experience tables
    Added Shroomlight to Herbalism experience tables
    Added Zoglin to combat experience tables
    Added Redstone Dust to bonus drops for Mining ( edit config.yml )
    Lodestone will now be ignored for activating abilities
    Respawn Anchor will now be ignored for activating abilities
    Soul Campfire will now be ignored for activating abilities

    Edit your experience.yml or delete it to generate a new one
    Edit config.yml and add Redstone_Dust under bonus drops for Mining, you could delete it to generate a new one but MySQL data is stored here

    Default experience.yml looks like this now: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mcMMO-Dev/mcMMO/master/src/main/resources/experience.yml

Version 2.1.128
    The first rank of Iron Arm for Unarmed now only gives 1.5 bonus damage instead of 4 (other ranks are the same as before)
    Blast Mining nerf reverted
    Fixed a bug where debris were not reduced from Blast Mining skills
    Fixed a bug where certain types of ore did not receive bonuses from Blast Mining
    Fixed a few locale errors with commands
    (API) Added ExperienceAPI::addCombatXP for adding combat XP to players, signature may change so its deprecated for now
    mcMMO now logs whether or not its using FlatFile or SQL database on load
    (1.16) Strider added to combat experience with a value of 1.2

    NOTES: A more thorough look at Unarmed balance will happen in the future, the intention of this nerf is to make Unarmed less rewarding until it is leveled quite a bit.
    I do plan to add saving XP bar settings to an upcoming version of mcMMO, but I'm working on another thing for mcMMO atm.

Version 2.1.127
    Child Skills now have XP bars, they are hidden by default
    Updated hu_HU locale (thanks andris155)
    Updated korean locale (thanks GownHeeJun)
    Fixed a potential resource leak (thanks f1xme)
    Fixed some potential chunk bugs (thanks f1xme)


    NOTES:
    You can enable the child skill bars with the command /mmoxpbar <skill> show

Version 2.1.126
    mcMMO now relies on NMS for some of its features, if NMS cannot properly be wired up when initializing mcMMO behaviours relying on NMS will either be partially supported or disabled
    mcMMO now has a compatibility mode, any features that require specific versions of Minecraft for full functionality will be disabled if your server is not running a compatible version, mcMMO will still function in compatibility mode, but either the feature will be modified or disabled depending on the version of the server software
    New command /mmocompat - Shows information about whether or not mcMMO is fully functional or if some features are disabled due to the server software not being fully supported. Can be used by players or console.
    New command /mmoxpbar (alias /xpbarsettings) - Players can choose to always show XP bars or to never show XP bars on a per skill basis
    XPBars now last for 3 seconds before hiding instead of 2 seconds
    Fixed an exploit involving fishing rods
    mcMMO is now less verbose about unsupported materials found in configs

    New locale strings
        Commands.Description.mmoxpbar
        Commands.Description.mmocompat
        Commands.XPBar.Reset
        Commands.XPBar.SettingChanged
        Compatibility.Layer.Unsupported
        Compatibility.Layer.PartialSupport


    Notes:
        There are no features that rely on NMS in this version, it took a lot of work to write the NMS framework and I'm going to delay implementation for future versions.
        /mmoxpbar (or /xpbarsettings) example usages
            /mmoxpbar show archery - Always show archery XP bar
            /mmoxpbar hide acrobatics - Never show acrobatics XP bar
            /mmoxpbar reset - Reset all settings related to XP bars (hide/show)

Version 2.1.125
    *Fixed a bug where you could not place blocks on top of certain repair/salvage anvils

    Notes: You won't be able to place blocks on top of stuff that has an interactable component if its setup as an anvil for either Repair or Salvage, for example if you set the vanilla minecraft anvil to Repair, you won't be able to place blocks on top of that. If the repair anvil is still set to iron block then you can now place blocks on it again.

Version 2.1.124
    Repair/Salvage can now be set to use vanilla blocks that already do something and that vanilla functionality will be disabled by mcMMO (you could use vanilla-anvils instead of iron_blocks for repair now)
    Added Gold_Nugget to Mining's Bonus_Drops in config.yml (edit your config)
    Added Piglin to experience.yml combat XP tables with a value of 2.0 (edit your config)
    Added Hoglin to experience.yml combat XP tables with a value of 4.0 (edit your config)
    Added Zombified_Piglin & Zombie_Pigman to experience.yml combat XP tables with a value of 3.0 (edit your config)

    For this update either edit experience.yml and config.yml manually or delete them to regenerate, keep in mind config.yml has MySQL settings so don't delete it carelessly.


Version 2.1.123
    Added 'Nether_Gold_Ore' to Mining XP tables in experience.yml with a value of 1300
    Adept Salvage message will now show the correct minimum level
    'Weeping_Vines' renamed to 'Weeping_Vines_Plant' in experience.yml (no edits necessary)
    'Twisted_Vines_Plant' added to Herbalism XP tables in experience.yml with a value of 10
    Weeping_Vines_Plant and Twisted_Vines_Plant are now flagged as multi-block plants in Herbalism

Version 2.1.122
    Changed the xp values for Nether_Wart_Block and Warped_Wart_Block from 20 to 1 for Woodcutting
    Changed the xp values for Nether_Wart_Block and Warped_Wart_Block from 20 to 3 for Herbalism
    mcMMO now treats Nether_Wart_Block and Warped_Wart_Block as leaves
    Removed Crimson_Roots and Warped_Roots from Woodcutting XP tables in experience.yml
    Added Crimson_Roots and Warped_Roots to Herbalism XP tables in experience.yml with a value of 6 XP
    Fixed some start up bugs for salvage/repair

    You can either edit experience.yml yourself or delete it to regenerate a new one to get the new changes

    Fixed a bug that can cause blast mining to give out more rewards than intended
    Blast Mining rewards are now randomized but still influenced by your blast mining rank
    mcMMO is now aware of turtle shell and treats it appropriately
    mcMMO is now aware of chainmail armor and treats it appropriately
    Calculations which change depend on the quality of your tool or armor has had netherrack support coded in
    All excavation drops that can drop from soul_sand now also drop from soul_soil (edited treasures.yml)

    Added netherite armor/weapons/tools to repair.vanilla.yml
    Added netherite armor/weapons/tools to salvage.vanilla.yml

    Added 'Bamboo_Sapling' to bonus drops for Herbalism in experience.yml
    Added 'Ancient_Debris' with a value of 7777 to Mining experience tables in experience.yml
    Added 'Basalt' with a value of 40 to Mining experience tables in experience.yml
    Added 'Crimson_Fungus' with a value of 50 to Herbalism experience tables in experience.yml

    NOTES: You will likely need to update repair.vanilla.yml, salvage.vanilla.yml and treasures.yml
    You can just delete those config files to regenerate them fresh which is much faster if you don't have any custom settings in those files
    Here are the default configuration files if you wish to compare them to your own servers settings while updating your configs.

    Netherrack is repaired using netherrack scraps for now, wait for 2.2 for a better version of repair.
    Netherrack salvages into netherrack scraps for now, wait for 2.2 for a better version of salvage.

    Repairing chainmail/etc will be tackled in 2.2 so don't expect that in this version

Version 2.1.116
    Fixed directional plants not maintaining their direction when replanted

Version 2.1.115
    Green Thumb now requires a hoe to activate
    Hoes no longer give free replants

    Using a hoe on non-fully grown crops will replant them as a convenience feature
    New sound option in sounds.yml called 'ITEM_CONSUMED', plays when eating seeds for Green Thumb
    Cocoa plants now require GT of at least 2 to start at the second stage of growth
    Green Terra now boosts growth on Green Thumb by 1 stage (doesn't go above the maximum value though)
    There is now a feature in place to prevent breaking a newly automatically replanted (via green thumb) crop from being breakable for a few seconds after it appears
    Fixed a bug where Salvage always gave the best results
    Fixed an issue with arrows causing exceptions with players not yet having data loaded

    Sweet Berry Bush's default Herbalism XP is now 50 instead of 300 (Update your experience.yml or delete it to generate a new one)

Version 2.1.111
    mcMMO is compatible with the following versions of MC: 1.15 / 1.14.4 / 1.14.3 / 1.14.2 / 1.14.1 / 1.14 / 1.13.2
    Further prevent nesting of bleed damage calls
    Warn about reparable/salvage configs with missing sections
    Added Bee combat experience modifier to experience.yml (Update your experience.yml file, see notes)
    Breaking a Bee Nest will result in Herbalism XP (Update your experience.yml file, see notes)
    Breeding bees will now result in Taming XP (Update your experience.yml file, see notes)

    NOTES:
        You will need to update your experience.yml by hand or delete it to get XP from new things in 1.15
        The default version of mcMMO's experience.yml looks like this: https://paste.gg/p/anonymous/15c34df6e60d45d9a3508b379a5e6514
        You'll want to add Bee to combat XP section, and Bee_Nest to Herbalism XP, and Bee to Taming XP section.

Version 2.1.110
    Fixed a dupe bug
    Actually fixed Block Cracker
    You can now crack Infested Stone Bricks with Block Cracker
    Added Lithuanian locale (thanks Vyciokazz)

Version 2.1.109
    Block Cracker will now correctly crack stone_bricks during Berserk again
    Added Lily_Of_The_Valley to the Bonus Drops list in config.yml (you'll probably want to add this manually) which enables it to double drop
    Added missing 1.14 blocks to ability/tool activation blacklists
    Fixed spamming of incompatible worldguard version message
    Updated Italian locale (thanks Fabrimat)

Version 2.1.108
    Fixed an amusing exploit for easy leveling in Acrobatics
    mcMMO should no longer break if FAWE is being used in conjunction with WG on the server
    Improved WG compatibility, mcMMO will now check if WG has loaded properly before hooking into it, which will prevent mcMMO from breaking if WG could not load properly.
    mcMMO now loads after worlds do during start up (which is what it should be doing)

    NOTES:
    Mobs will now only reward Dodge XP a certain amount of times
    You can turn off this exploit prevention by disabling ExploitFix.Acrobatics in experience.yml

Version 2.1.107
    Fixed an exploit that allowed automated XP gain for Excavation
    Fixed encoding of russian translation
    New API event McMMOPlayerProfileLoadEvent (thanks Shrek5InTheatres2019)

Version 2.1.106
    Added a few missing blocks to the ability blacklist tables (prevents readying/using abilities on certain blocks that have right click functionality)
    Updated Japanese locale (thanks ethernetcat)
    Updated Simplified Chinese locale (thanks Fu_Meng)

Version 2.1.105
    mcMMO will reset players scoreboard to the main scoreboard if they move into a blacklisted world
    Beast lore now shows max jump height and other tweaks (Thanks QuantumToasted)
    If the server has enabled level caps (which are not on by default) players will be shown that they are at max level instead of seeing how much XP needed to reach an impossible level (thanks Shrek5InTheatres2019)
    Large update to Italian locale (thanks Leomixer17)

    NOTES:
    The scoreboard change should result in mcMMO removing scoreboards from players properly when they enter a black listed world. This is a hacky band aid fix as our scoreboard code is archaic and needs to be rewritten in 2.2 and not 2.1. Expect a scoreboard overhaul sometime in the future.

Version 2.1.104
    Fixed a bug resulting in many errors when using Rupture
    Large update to the Japanese locale (thanks ethernetcat)
    Updated Hungarian locale (thanks andris)

Version 2.1.103
    Treasure item amount will default to 1 if not specified instead of breaking mcMMO
    Fishing treasures will now return the amount defined in treasures config file, an option to randomize amounts will be coming in the future. See notes.
    Fixed a bug where Tree Feller was only rewarding 1 XP per log broken no matter the circumstances
    Fixed an issue with salvage checking the incorrect level requirement
    Updated Italian locale (thanks Leomixer17)
    Fixed grammar in one of the Salvage strings (thanks QuantumToasted)

    NOTES:
    Sometime in 2014 a decision was made that any fishing treasure over the amount of 1 will be randomized in its yield, while this is not necessarily a bad thing it means control over the drop is a bit random. I've removed this randomness temporarily, in the future you will be able to chose if the amount is randomized or static.

Version 2.1.102
    Scoreboards will now be removed from players who teleport to a blacklisted world
    Fixed a bug where Rupture could trigger itself

Version 2.1.101
    Fixed an exploit where chorus plants could be used to gain automatic XP
    Added blast furnace, cartography table, grindstone, lectern, loom, scaffolding, smoker, stonecutter, and sweet berry bush to the list of internal blocks that don't trigger tool readying

Version 2.1.100
    Fixed a bug where plants could double drop when the skill was not yet unlocked
    Fixed a bug where plants ALWAYS double dropped
    mcnotify command now checks that it's being executed by a player
    Fixed some concurrency concerns around BleedTasks
    Fixed an NPE that may occur with random chances on a player without loaded data
    Updated Russian locale (thanks myfbone!)

Version 2.1.99
    MASSIVE update to the Russian locale (ru) credit to myfbone
    Debug mode (/mmodebug) will now print info about XP perks and how they are modifying your incoming XP

Version 2.1.98
    Fixed a bug that prevented Taming XP from combat

Version 2.1.97
    mcMMO is compatible with 1.14.4 (Didn't require any changes)
    Fixed a NPE that could occur if a pet participated in combat and its master's mcMMO data was not available
    mcMMO now properly closes its region files as it creates them (thanks Yukiiro-Nite)
    Updated Hungarian locale (thanks andris)

Version 2.1.96
    Added the setting 'Skills.General.LimitBreak.AllowPVE' to advanced.yml to allow Limit Break damage bonus to apply in PVE again, defaults to false
    Updated Limit Break locale strings
    Fixed a few more places where 'Archaeology' was misspelled in the locale
    Added the setting 'ExploitFix.PistonCheating' to experience.yml at the request of a user
    Added a missing 's' to Nether_Bricks (thanks Sikatsu) in experience.yml

    NOTES:
    The Skill Tooltips are a bit limited right now, in the future they will be more flexible. In order to reflect that Limit Break doesn't always work in PVE (now up to server settings) I added a crappy note to its hover window tip. I'll be fixing this in the future.
    You shouldn't need to update you config entry for Nether_Bricks, I believe that file updates automatically (the old config system is a bit janky, some stuff updates, some other stuff doesn't.)
    PistonCheating prevents blocks from being marked "natural" once they've been moved, we've never had an option for this before.
    A discord user requested it, its a strange request but I added it anyways.
    Of course, it defaults to "true" which prevents cheating with pistons.

Version 2.1.95
    Added missing Chorus_Fruit & Chorus_Plant entries to Herbalism's Bonus Drops in config.yml (See notes)
    Limit Break now does dramatically less damage to players with lower grades of armor
    Limit Break damage bonuses now only apply to Players
    Updated in game text to reflect changes to Limit Break
    Fixed a bug where opponents used your stats instead of their own to activate Iron Grip
    Fixed a bug preventing Wandering Traders from granting XP
    Fixed a bug that prevented Chorus Tree's from giving full XP if you broke anything other than the bottom block
    Fixed a bug which could cause Large Fern's to reward less XP
    Fixed a bug where certain herbalism crops could have fewer than intended bonus drops
    Fixed a bug involving Ender Pearl and Acrobatics
    Added some protection to Acrobatics to prevent gaining too much XP in one Roll.
    Added 'Carrots, Cocoa, Potatoes, Wheat, Beetroots, Nether_Wart' to Herbalism in experience.yml (See notes)
    Removed the _Ripe entries from experience.yml (no longer used)
    Updated locale string 'Swords.SubSkill.SwordsLimitBreak.Description' & 'Swords.SubSkill.SwordsLimitBreak.Stat'
    Added missing 'Chorus_Flower' entry to herbalism in experience.yml
    Added some debug messages about XP gains if you are in debug mode
    Added some debug messages for Acrobatics if you are in debug mode
    Added some debug messages for Herbalism if you are in debug mode

    NOTES:
    Add 'Chorus_Fruit' and 'Chorus_Plant' under Bonus_Drops.Herbalism in config.yml or you will not be getting double drops for Chorus Fruit.
    You shouldn't need to add "Chorus_Flower, Carrots, Cocoa, Potatoes, Wheat, Beetroots, Nether_Wart" to your experience file, it seems that config file updates automatically for missing entries.

Version 2.1.94
    2 new devs have joined the mcMMO team (electronicboy, kashike), bringing the active dev team to 3 including myself! Strings relating to authors of mcMMO have been updated to reflect this
    Fixed a bug where 2 people using Tree Feller could result in the tree being rejected for being too big
    New command /mmodebug (or /mcmmodebugmode) - Prints useful information when players punch blocks while they are in debug mode
    mcMMO no longer prints debug information when you attack stuff with the debug stick, use the new command (/mmodebug) instead
    Added locale string 'mcMMO.Description.FormerDevs'
    Added locale string 'mcMMO.Template.Prefix'
    Added locale string 'Commands.Mmodebug.Toggle'
    Added locale string 'Commands.Description.mmodebug'
    Tweaked locale string 'mcMMO.Description'
    Updated Japanese locale (thanks snake)
    Updated hu_HU locale (thanks andris155)

Version 2.1.93
    Fixed a bug where players would be told they could not breed summoned animals when the animals weren't summoned (bug didn't actually do anything besides send you a message)

Version 2.1.92
    Call Of The Wild (COTW) no longer cares if entities of the same type are nearby when attempting to summon a new entity
    Fixed a bug where COTW summon limit was global instead of per player
    If you are playing in 1.14 mcMMO will now summon cats instead of ocelots
    The default summon limit for COTW is now per player instead of global which is how it should be, for wolves this defaults to 2, for other entities it defaults to 1
    The COTW setting named Summon_Max_Amount in config.yml has been renamed to Per_Player_Limit
    By default players are no longer allowed to breed COTW summoned animals with other animals, you can turn this off (see the notes)
    If a player tries to breed animals with a COTW animal and the server settings prevent this, they are informed via a message that it is not allowed
    If the COTW summon has a lifespan, players are now informed about this lifespan when the entity is first summoned
    COTW entities now send the player a message when they die, time out, or get removed through other means
    COTW summons now have their name prefixed with some colored text to to make it easier to identify them.
    COTW summons now despawn if their owner logs out
    There is now a small 150ms window in which you cannot summon an entity via COTW to prevent accidentally summoning extra entities
    COTW Horses, Cats, and Wolves now always spawn in as adults
    Changed the sound effect for COTW (Fireworks -> Pop)
    Most COTW messages have been tweaked and new COTW messages have been added
    Added new setting to experience.yml 'ExploitFix.COTWBreeding' - Prevents breeding with COTW summoned entities when set to true, defaults to true
    Removed the 'mcmmo.ability.taming.callofthewild.renamepets' permission node as it is seen as unnecessary

    Removed locale strings
        Taming.Summon.Fail.Ocelot
        Taming.Summon.Fail.Wolf
        Taming.Summon.Fail.Horse
        Taming.Summon.Fail.TooMany
        Taming.Summon.Lifespan
    Added new locale strings
        Taming.Summon.COTW.NeedMoreItems
        Taming.Summon.COTW.BreedingDisallowed
        Taming.Summon.COTW.Success.WithLifespan
        Taming.Summon.COTW.Success.WithoutLifespan
        Taming.Summon.COTW.Limit
        Taming.Summon.COTW.TimeExpired
    Tweaked locale string
        Taming.Summon.Name.Format

    NOTES:
    I plan to rework Call of The Wild (COTW) significantly in the upcoming content patch, until then I have made several tweaks to it.

    COTW Summoning Requirement Changes
    It is intentional that you are not supposed to be able to COTW summon something that you already have tamed, but mcMMO was not checking this properly.
    So previous to this patch, if you tried to summon a wolf and wolves were nearby, it would fail. This is not intentional behaviour and was a bug.
    The correct behaviour is that if you try to summon a wolf and you already have wolves, it should fail.
    I was fixing this bug when it occurred to me, why do we even care if nearby tamed wolves owned by you exist if you are trying to summon a temporary one?
    As a result of this train of thought, I have removed this restriction on COTW and several other tweaks have been made as a result of this line of thinking.
    There was also an issue involving how many COTW entities could be out at once, for some reason the limit was applied globally and defaulted to 10, so if 10 players had COTW entities out no one else would be able to summon anything. I have fixed this.
    You can set the lifespan to 0 in the config to make it so that COTW entities last until a server restart or the player logs out.

    COTW Breeding Change
    It was never intentional for COTW summoned entities to be breedable, by default they will not be. You can change this by setting 'ExploitFix.COTWBreeding' to false in experience.yml

Version 2.1.91
    mcMMO is now more compatible with plugins that spawn arrows in unexpected ways, this fixes some NPE in mcMMO when using certain plugins
    Fixed a bug where Unarmed was using the same CD timer for every player in the server (thanks slop_me)

Version 2.1.90
    Salvaged items now travel much slower towards the player
    Books from salvage will now travel towards the player
    Salvaged items travelling towards you will now have their speed adjusted based on distance

    Common Materials found when mining have had their XP gains reduced and rare materials have had their XP gains increased
    Diamond Ore has had its XP increased from 750 to 2400
    Gold Ore has had its XP increased from 350 to 1300
    Iron Ore has had its XP increased from 250 to 900
    Lapis Ore has had its XP increased from 400 to 800
    Nether Quartz Ore has had its XP increased from 100 to 300
    Redstone Ore has had its XP increased from 150 to 600
    Blue_Ice has had its default XP value reduced to 15
    Packed_Ice has had its default XP value reduced to 15
    Netherrack has had its default XP value reduced to 15
    Coal Ore has had its XP increased from 100 to 400
    Stone has had its XP decreased from 30 to 15
    Granite has had its XP decreased from 30 to 15
    Andesite has had its XP decreased from 30 to 15
    Diorite has had its XP decreased from 30 to 15
    End Stone has had its XP decreased from 30 to 15
    Glow Stone has had its XP decreased from 30 to 15
    End Bricks has had its XP decreased from 200 to 50


    NOTES:
    You can either apply the default XP changes manually to experience.yml or delete it to generate a new file

    Sorry about salvaged items traveling too quickly, in testing on my LAN server with ideal conditions they always entered my inventory and never shot past me so the high speed of the items was not an apparent issue.
    I've tested the new changes to how they travel towards you pretty thoroughly, they never go fast enough to go past you and they adjust their speed based on distance to you with some speed limitations.
    In testing the new tweaks work well whether the salvage anvil is above, below, or at the same height as you.

    I'll be tweaking XP values across all skills more carefully in the upcoming content patch due after 2.2. Some tweaks to XP gains will be applied for 2.2.

Version 2.1.89
    Many changes were made to this version that affect default values in the config, read the notes carefully if you wish to apply these changes. They are optional.
    mcMMO is compatible with the new 1.14.3, in addition to this it is still compatible with 1.14.2, 1.14.1, 1.14, and 1.13.2. This did not require any changes to be made to mcMMO, but I thought I'd add this to the notes for those wondering.

    RetroMode is the default level scaling mode again
    The default level for players has been changed back to 0 from 1 (you can change it back to 1 by editing 'Skills.General.StartingLevel' in advanced.yml) if you wish to apply this change read the notes
    Super Abilities now scale in length up to level 100/1000 instead of 50/500 by default (you can edit this in advanced.yml under 'Skills.General.Ability.Length.xxx')
    Early Game Boost now only applies when leveling from level 0 to level 1
    Removed the config setting 'MaxLevelMultiplier' from experience.yml as it is no longer used.
    When finding a treasure via Excavation players have a 1-8% chance to have a small amount vanilla experience orbs to be found alongside the treasure, the chance and number of orbs are based on the players Archaeology rank
    Tweaked the locale string 'Excavation.SubSkill.Archaeology.Description'
    Added locale string 'Excavation.SubSkill.Archaeology.Stat'
    Added locale string 'Excavation.SubSkill.Archaeology.Stat.Extra'
    Tweaked the locale string 'Fishing.SubSkill.MasterAngler.Stat'
    The interval at which you can gain Acrobatics XP from fall damage has been reduced to 3 seconds from 10 seconds, this will be configurable in 2.2.

    When using WorldGuard (WG) with mcMMO, mcMMO now examines WG more carefully to determine if it is a compatible version or not, see the notes. Keep in mind WG is optional and not needed to run mcMMO.
    Fixed a bug that could result in Tree Feller failing to remove parts of a tree in snowy biomes. (This fix won't apply retroactively to old trees, see the notes)
    Updated Japanese locale (thanks snake)
    Tree Feller and other Super Abilities will damage tools with the Enchantment named 'Durability/Unbreaking' again, this does not apply to the NBT tag named Ubreakable (Unbreakable NBT tag is safe from damage however, try not to confuse them as they share similar names)
    Added new setting 'ExploitFix.TreeFellerReducedXP' to experience.yml
    Tree Feller will no longer give full XP for each block destroyed and instead give diminishing returns on XP for each block removed. You can turn this off by setting 'ExploitFix.TreeFellerReducedXP' in experience.yml to false
    Many skills which used to unlock at level 5/50 now unlock at level 1 instead
    Arrow Retrieval now unlocks at level 1 in both Standard and RetroMode
    Skill Shot now unlocks at level 1 in both Standard and RetroMode
    Dodge now unlocks at level 1 in both Standard and RetroMode
    Critical Strikes now unlocks at level 1 in both Standard and RetroMode
    Armor Impact now unlocks at level 1 in both Standard and RetroMode
    Beast Lore now unlocks at level 1 in both Standard and RetroMode
    Call Of The Wild now unlocks at level 1 in both Standard and RetroMode
    Scrap Collector now unlocks at level 1 in both Standard and RetroMode
    Treasure Hunter now unlocks at level 1 in both Standard and RetroMode
    Rupture now unlocks at level 1 in both Standard and RetroMode
    Iron Arm Style now unlocks at level 1 in both Standard and RetroMode
    Harvest Lumber now unlocks at level 1 in both Standard and RetroMode
    Archaeology now unlocks at level 1 in both Standard and RetroMode
    Repair Mastery now unlocks at level 1 in both Standard and RetroMode
    Double Drops (Herbalism and Mining) now have ranks and unlock at level 1 in both Standard and RetroMode
    Concoctions rank 2 now unlocks at Level 1 for both Standard and RetroMode
    Serrated Strikes now unlocks at levels 5/50 instead of 10/100
    Berserk now unlocks at levels 5/50 instead of 10/100

    NOTES:
    I'm looking into adding 1.12.2 support sooner than expected.

    Editing your config files is not required for this patch (and never will be), however I would highly recommend it. Read the notes below this line carefully.
    If you want to update to this patch easily and you don't mind default config values, delete skillranks.yml, advanced.yml, and experience.yml before starting your server with 2.1.89 of mcMMO applied.
    Many skills now unlock at level 1 and the default starting level is back to 0. It is recommended you change this number from 1 to 0 manually by editing 'Skills.General.StartingLevel' in advanced.yml or deleting advanced.yml and generating a new file when 2.1.89 starts.
    It is recommended you make the manual edits to skillranks.yml to apply this change or delete skillranks.yml and a new one will be generated once you start 2.1.89.

    Early Game Boost was used to help players get to level 5 quickly by boosting their XP until they got there, this caused some confusion as they appeared to be 'learning a skill' for multiple levels, on RetroMode this lasted until level 50.
    I have changed Early Game Boost to only last from level 0-1 on both RetroMode and Standard, and now important skills are unlocked at level 1.
    I was going to wait until 2.2 was done to deploy this change, but 2.2 is some time away and the previous system was causing some confusion.
    Early Game Boost gives players extra XP for skills that are level 0, you can turn this system off by setting 'EarlyGameBoost.Enabled' in experience.yml to false
    Early Game Boost will show 'Learning a new skill...' if XP bars are enabled

    https://mcmmo.org/wiki/World_guard - A list of WG flags supported by mcMMO.
    It is not necessary to have WG installed, but if you do have WG installed mcMMO hooks into it to provide some additional features.
    Previously mcMMO used to determine if WG was compatible just by checking to see if it was version 7 of WG, however version 7 of WG is not guaranteed to be compatible as necessary classes that mcMMO hooks into were added during its development and some users are still running early dev versions of WG7.
    In order to decrease the chance of error, mcMMO now uses reflection when checking to see if WG is compatible in addition to checking its version number, if its not compatible mcMMO will print a message and refrain from hooking into WG.
    WG is an optional dependency for mcMMO, and unfortunately before this change if mcMMO thought you were running a compatible version of WG and it turned out you weren't then mcMMO would not function correctly.

    Archaeology does something now, it will be tweaked again in the future. Previously rank 1 of Archaeology was required to find treasures but that was all it did, now each rank of Archaeology also adds a small chance to find experience orbs when a player finds treasure.

    In a prior patch I removed damage on tools if they had Unbreakable NBT or Unbreaking Enchantment, at the time I made this change I did not realize they were different things and just shared the same name, this patch fixes this mistake. My intention was to prevent damage on tools with the NBT unbreakable tag which makes an item never suffer from durability loss.
    mcMMO reduces damage to tools from super abilities if they have the "Durability/Unbreaking" enchantment already, this behaviour has been in mcMMO for a long time.

    Tree Feller will now give reduced XP per block destroyed by Tree Feller and will never go below 1 XP per block, you can turn this off with 'ExploitFix.TreeFellerReducedXP' in experience.yml
    There was a bug fixed in this patch that prevents an issue where Tree Feller was not removing all blocks left behind, unfortunately this will only affect new trees made in the world. The only trees that suffered from this bug were ones in snowy areas that had snow form on them.

    RetroMode and Standard mode will be getting renamed in 2.2, probably to something like 1000-scale and 100-scale respectively.
    Retro Mode was accidental genius is the short reason for the change to make it the default level scaling for mcMMO again.
    Standard Mode is not going anywhere, it is just opt-in now instead of the default.
    If you delete config.yml you will need to turn RetroMode off to use Standard mode as mcMMO doesn't keep track of what level scaling you are using outside of that.

Version 2.1.88
    mcMMO is now more compatible with a plugin named Project Korra
    mcMMO will no longer process combat triggers for damage at or below 0

Version 2.1.87
    (Level caps are not on by default in mcMMO, this is something you can turn on)

    Players who reach either the power level cap or skill level cap will now be informed that they have done so
    XP Bars will no longer be sent to players who have reached the power level or skill level cap respectively
    Level up messages will no longer be sent to players who have reached the power level or skill level cap respectively
    Fixed a bug where mcMMO would send level up notifications to a player if the custom level up event from mcMMO was cancelled
    New locale strings 'LevelCap.PowerLevel' & 'LevelCap.Skill'

Version 2.1.86
    Players will no longer be told they got a perfect result when salvaging if they are below max skill level
    Salvage results will now travel towards the player instead of moving in a random direction
    (FIX) You cannot view stats of players who are offline if your server limits the range on inspect for you via permissions or settings
    (FIX) Players will no longer be told they lack skill in salvage if they already qualify for the best possible result for the item
    (FIX) Fixed a bug where arcane salvage was being used to calculate salvage results instead of scrap collector
    (FIX) Added the missing locale color for 'Commands.Party.Commands'
    Modified colors used in locale strings 'Salvage.Skills.Lottery.Normal', 'Salvage.Skills.Lottery.Perfect', and 'Profile.Loading.FailurePlayer'
    When failing to load a profile mcMMO will increase the amount of time it waits before reattempting to load the profile for each failure

    NOTES:
    You can (and always have been able) to turn off the inspect range check by setting it to 0 in the config
    2.2 is around the corner, most things are functional, still a lot of work left to do.

Version 2.1.85
    Fixed a nearly 6 year old bug where Super Repair was not included as a child permission under Repair ability permission nodes (which meant some players would not have access to this skill)
    Fixed a bug that could prevent salvage from working for certain players
    Renamed the advanced salvage permission node to 'mcmmo.ability.salvage.scrapcollector'
    Fixed a bug that would send players skill unlock notifications if they did not have the permission node for that skill
    Dramatically increased the chance of receiving full materials when salvaging

Version 2.1.84
    Added some code to make mcMMO more compatible with EpicSpawners

Version 2.1.83
    You can no longer set party members on fire with your bow
    (FIX) Arrow Retrieval will no longer work with piercing enchant on crossbows
    WG Flags should now correctly recognize when a projectile belongs to a player and respect flag settings
    Updated hu_HU locale (thanks andris155)

Version 2.1.82
    Added new WG flag 'mcmmo-hardcore' if set to negative players will not be penalized by hardcore mode (if hardcore mode is enabled) it defaults to true
    Added proper error handling when loading parties file
    Fixed an error that could occur when using mcrank on an offline player
    You can now use mcrank on offline players by default
    You can now use inspect on offline players by default
    Removed the offline inspect/mcrank permissions
    Updated Chinese locale (thanks to the user named 89009332 from github)
    Added some redundancy checks when loading profiles (NPC checks to be specific)

    NOTES:
    There were reasons to prevent inspecting offline players in the past, I don't see any reason for them anymore so I've removed the restriction.

Version 2.1.81
    Fixed a bug where Arrow Deflect would never trigger outside of PVP
    Fixed a bug where failing to salvage enchantments incorrectly colored the text
    mcMMO no longer allows players to keep enchantments exceeding normal limitations by default when salvaging or repairing (you can turn this off in the config, see below)
    Added new setting 'ExploitFix.UnsafeEnchantments' to experience.yml, turn this on to allow players to salvage/repair enchantments higher than normal game restrictions

    NOTES:
    If a player tries to salvage/repair an item with an illegal enchant (for example Sharpness X) it will downgrade that item to the highest legal version when calculating rewards
    If you don't like this change you can turn it off in experience.yml under 'ExploitFix.UnsafeEnchantments'


Version 2.1.80
    (Fix) mcMMO now respects the NBT "Unbreakable" tag and does not deal durability damage to items with that tag

Version 2.1.79
    Updated Japanese locale (Thanks snake0053)
    Fixed a NPE that could happen when using Tree Feller with an unenchanted Axe

Version 2.1.78
    Shovels no longer take more than 1 diamond to repair
    Tools with the unbreaking enchantment no longer take extra damage from ability usage, they are still subject to the normal durability damage from breaking blocks though.

Version 2.1.77
    Added minimum quantity back to Repair config

    NOTES: I removed this last patch because I did not consider that server admins might be allowing users to repair items without crafting recipes (as of last patch mcMMO determines minimum quantity via counting ingredients in a recipe)
    If you do not define minimum quantity in the repair config, mcMMO will grab the minimum quantity automatically as I programmed it to do as of last patch, otherwise if it is defined, mcMMO will respect that and use that for calculations.
    The minimum quanitty should be set to the number of ingredients used to craft the recipe, for example 8 for diamond chestplate etc, you do not need to define this unless you are allowing players to repair custom items.

Version 2.1.76
    Advanced Salvage has been renamed to Scrap Collector
    Scrap Collector has 8 ranks, the first rank is unlocked at level 2 (Level 20 in RetroMode)
    You can not salvage without at least 1 rank in Scrap Collector now (formerly Advanced Salvage)
    Fixed a bug where Repair was repairing too much
    Fixed a bug where Arcane Salvage was used to determine how many materials a player could salvage from an item instead of Scrap Collector (formerly Advanced Salvage)
    Fixed a bug where messages about an item being too damage to salvage were being sent twice
    Removed the minimum quantity field from the repair config
    Removed the item data (metadata) field from repair config as its not used anymore
    Salvage will no longer return the max amount of materials possible, instead you are guaranteed one item and then some luck is involved on how many items are returned.
    Updated Chinese locale (thanks to the user named 89009332 from github)

    New locale strings
        Salvage.Skills.Lottery.Normal
        Salvage.Skills.Lottery.Perfect
        Salvage.Skills.Lottery.Untrained
        Salvage.SubSkill.ScrapCollector.Name
        Salvage.SubSkill.ScrapCollector.Description
        Salvage.SubSkill.ScrapCollector.Stat

    (API) SALVAGE_ARCANE_SALVAGE in SubSkillType has been renamed to SALVAGE_SCRAP_COLLECTOR

    NOTES:
    You do not need to update your configs for this update.

    How Salvage works
    As an example, say you had enough skill to gain up to 5 items from salvaging something, and that item has enough durability to yield up to 5 materials, salvage will play out like this...
    First off, you will be guaranteed 1 material, after this you have 80% chance to get the next material, if successful, another dice roll is conducted but lowers your odds by 20%, you chance to succeed will never fall below 33%
    If you fail a dice roll, it will still conduct dice rolls for the remaining maximum amount of materials returned but your odds of success are only lowered upon a successful dice roll, the sum of the successful dice rolls is used to calculate how many items you are given back, the first item is guaranteed and has no dice rolls, which means for example the Diamond Shovel will always succeed.

Version 2.1.75
    Fixed a bug that prevented Fortune from working correctly if a Double Drop was triggered

Version 2.1.74
    Fixed a NPE that could occur during certain events if a skill was disabled in coreskills.yml (Sorry!)

Version 2.1.73
    Fixed a NPE that could occur if an entire skill was disabled in coreskills.yml

Version 2.1.72
    Fixed a NPE if a server shutdown with no player data needing to be saved (the error is harmless but spammy)
    Fixed a NPE that could occur if Roll was disabled in coreskills.yml

Version 2.1.71
    Salvage will now always ask for confirmation before breaking your items (instead of only asking for enchanted items)
    Repair will now always ask for confirmation before repairing items (instead of only asking for enchanted items)
    Gold & Iron Blocks will no longer trigger tool ready messages
    Salvage & Repair anvils will no longer work on multi-item stacks

    NOTES: You can still turn the confirmation off in config.yml

Version 2.1.70
    Added new DatabaseAPI to the API package, has features relating to database operations
    Fixed a bug where shulker boxes (without colors) would activate tool ready messages

Version 2.1.69
    Fixed a few places where mcMMO would not save player data immediately which may cause players to lose a few minutes of progress

    A big thanks to Sleepyflea for helping test this patch and report this bug.

Version 2.1.68
    Updated Japanese locale (thanks Snake)
    Fixed a bug where consuming food in the off hand did not trigger the Diet abilities

Version 2.1.67
    The XP bar now reflects whether or not the player is receiving the early game boost
    Players who are receiving an early game boost will be shown "Learning a skill..." as the title of the XP bar while gaining XP
    New locale string 'XPBar.Template.EarlyGameBoost'

    NOTES:
    You can turn off this system in experience.yml 'EarlyGameBoost.Enabled'
    The Early Game Boost is a system in which players receive drastically increased XP gains for the first few levels (until the first set of skills are unlocked)
    With default settings, this means players will be receiving boosted XP for the first 5 levels (50 for Retro)
    The Early Game Boost ends when players get the first skill in each ability under default settings
    The main purpose of this system is to alleviate progression issues with a few skills where the first set of unlocked abilities drastically increase how fun it is to level the skill
    The secondary purpose of this system is to alleviate any psychological issues when grinding towards the first set of unlocks by making the first set of unlocks happen quickly
    This system has been in place for a few versions now, but without an in game indicator of what was going on.
    If you have XP bars off there is still no indicator that this system is in place, I'll address that at some point.

Version 2.1.66
    Fixed a bug that could happen if a player was removed from the DB when using MySQL/MariaDB when the user was offline
    Fixed a minor memory leak for MySQL

Version 2.1.65
    Corrected a bug that would cause RetroMode to use Linear formula regardless of setting

Version 2.1.64
    Corrected how Standard mode (1-100 scaling) XP to next level was calculated, it is now a true 1:10 ratio with Retro (1-1000) scale, which is how it was intended to be to begin with
    Fixed a bug that caused skill messages to spam nearby players
    (API) method to get XP in FormulaManager has been renamed to getXPtoNextLevel(...), this shouldn't break anything as plugins should be using our Experience API methods instead of this
    (API) Added method getLevel(Player player, PrimarySkillType primarySkillType) to ExperienceAPI.java


    NOTE: The net result of this change is it will take a bit longer to level with Standard, but it should not be a drastic change. You might not even notice it.
    Standard is meant to take the same amount of time to level from levels 1-100 as it takes Retro to do 1-1000, this change corrects from errors in the code that made Standard actually take less XP than Retro despite intending for it to be a cosmetic difference in progression.
    I made a google sheet visualizing the difference between Standard and Retro Mode using default settings and Linear formula - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VlJtvNHlypACHyz_zulEdhgLwFjL01xMPkqlnu0XBSs/edit?usp=sharing

Version 2.1.63
    Fixed Armor Impact not scaling by skill rank
    Significantly Buffed the amount of durability damage incurred by a successful Armor Impact
    Added new setting to advanced.yml 'Skills.Axes.ArmorImpact.DamagePerRank' which is multiplied against Armor Impact's skill level to determine damage done to armor
    Fixed a bug that caused creative mode players to gain XP when qualifying for early game XP boosts
    Removed the damage cap setting for Armor Impact, it is inherently capped now based on its max rank and damage setting
    Updated hu_HU locale (thanks andris155)
    Updated ja_JP locale (thanks snake)

    NOTES:
    Armor Impact only has a 25% chance to go off, and for it to only incur 20 durability damage seemed incredibly underwhelming, I've buffed it quite a bit.
    You can change it back to its underwhelming self by setting DamagePerRank to 1.0
    Based on feedback I may tweak the number again or other properties of this skill

Version 2.1.62
    Added a new admin notification system, sensitive commands will print chat messages to "admins" (players with either Operator status or admin chat permission)
    Added a setting to disable the new admin notifications to config.yml 'General.AdminNotifications' (this will be more configurable in 2.2)
    OPs and players with the admin chat permission will now see details about XP rate event commands regardless of whether or not the XP rate event messages are enabled
    Updated hu_HU locale (thanks andris155)
    Added XP for mining Magma_Block (default 30 XP - Update your config, see notes)
    Diamond tools & armor in the repair config now have a minimum level of 0 (Update your config, temporary hotfix, 2.2 addresses this issue, see notes)
    Guardian default combat XP multiplier reduced from 3.0 to 1.0 (update config if you want this change)
    New locale string - 'Server.ConsoleName' the name of the server console, this will be used in place of player names when sending admin notifications out if the command was used from console
    New locale string - 'Notifications.Admin.Format.Others' style formatting + prefix for admin notifications used in the other new strings below
    New locale string - 'Notifications.Admin.Format.Self' style formatting + prefix for admin command confirmations sent to the user who executed the command
    New locale string - 'Notifications.Admin.XPRate.Start.Self' sent to the user who modifies the XP rate regardless of whether or not messages for the event are enabled
    New locale string - 'Notifications.Admin.XPRate.Start.Others' details of who started an XP rate event are sent to players who have Operator status or admin chat permission when the command to start or modify XP of an event has been issued
    New locale string - 'Notifications.Admin.XPRate.End.Self' sent to the user who ended the XP rate event regardless of whether or not messages for the event are enabled
    New locale string - 'Notifications.Admin.XPRate.End.Others' details of who ended an XP rate event are sent to players who have Operator status or admin chat permission when the command to end the event has been issued

    NOTES:
    Admin notifications currently only reports use of the XP rate command, it will be expanded to support other commands in upcoming patches
    Add an entry of 'Magma_Block: 30' under Mining in experience.yml section titled "Experience_Values" (or you can delete the file to generate a new one with default values, 2.2 is coming soon which will have brand new configs so you could just wait for that
    2.2 is the config rewrite, in this rewrite Repair and Salvage configs have been partially rewritten, it is not intended for Diamond Repair to take until level 50 in Standard level scaling to be available, since it'd be redundant to fix this in 2.1.X when 2.2 fixes it and its about to come out, the minimum level has temporarily been changed to 0. You can either update your repair.vanilla.yml config manually or delete it to generate a new one.

    Admin notifications are a step in the right direction for finding naughty admins in mcMMO, I will be changing which permission node is used for players to be considered an admin in the future as not everyone wants or uses admin chat.
    I expect to add logging of admin commands which will be viewable in game via command, so you won't have to have access to the servers log files to view who has been executing what.

Version 2.1.61
    Fixed the locale string formatting of 'Mining.SubSkill.DoubleDrops.Stat'
    Updated the Japanese locale (thanks snake0053)
    Added toggle to turn off event message broadcasts (XP rate) to config.yml - 'General.EventBroadcasts'
    Added toggle to not inform players of events when they join (XP rate, etc) to config.yml 'General.EventInfoOnPlayerJoin'
    Added anti-exploit protection for cobble/stone farms which can be automated, to turn this off you can toggle the new config options 'ExploitFix.LavaStoneAndCobbleFarming' in experience.yml

    NOTE: The toggle for event message broadcasts is separate from the titles being shown, that's another config option (titles are the BIG TEXT in the middle of the screen)
    NOTE: The new anti-stone/cobble automation will not prevent XP gains from obsidian, since Obsidian requires some effort to farm

Version 2.1.60
    Fixed a NPE error if a LivingEntity's target was set to null
    Fixed a bug where tamed mobs could kill themselves if their owner shot them once
    Corrected a typo when naming entities summoned by COTW (Locale string - Taming.Summon.Name.Format)
    Fixed a bug where tamed mobs could have hearts instead of their name in their own death messages
    Fixed a bug where multi-block crops would fail to double/triple drop (Sugar Cane, Cactus, etc)
    Optimized the bonus drop code to reduce overhead

Version 2.1.59
    Raised the overfishing limit from 3 to 10
    Improved the overfishing messages to be more clear about its mechanics
    Overfishing locale keys renamed "Fishing.ScarcityTip" and "Fishing.LowResourcesTip"

    NOTES: This and other exploit prevention measures are much more customizable in 2.2, which shouldn't be too far off.

Version 2.1.58
    Fixed the wrong locale string being used for Mining Double Drops

Version 2.1.57
    Fixed an incredibly rare dupe bug that only happened with VERY specific config options that was extremely difficult to pull off

Version 2.1.56
    Very large update to the zh_CN Chinese language file (thanks Dream_m)

Version 2.1.55
    Fixed a bug that could occur when adding UUIDs to old outdated DBs

Version 2.1.54
    Fixed a bug where the Skill 'Understanding the Art' was preventing vanilla experience orbs from furnaces
    Fixed 'Understanding the Art' not correctly boosting vanilla XP from furnaces

Version 2.1.53
    Fixed a critical bug where players earned too much XP

Version 2.1.52
    Updated Japanese locale (thanks snake0053)
    Added a toggle for the early game XP boost to experience.yml 'EarlyGameBoost.Enabled'
    Added a max level multiplier for determining early game boosts cutoff to experience.yml 'EarlyGameBoost.MaxLevelMultiplier'

Version 2.1.51
    You can now customize a locale outside of the JAR! (Thanks mikroskeem)
    Added a new locale reload command 'mmolocalereload' (Thanks mikroskeem)
    Locales can now be overriden by placing a file with an appropriate name inside /plugins/mcMMO/locales/ (Thanks mikroskeem)

    NOTES
    You can find the up to date current en_US locale entries here: https://github.com/mcMMO-Dev/mcMMO/blob/master/src/main/resources/locale/locale_en_US.properties
    You do NOT have to replace the whole locale, you can replace only the strings you want to!
    Locales only support ASCII and UTF16 characters at the moment, so you'll need to run special characters through a UTF16 converter (google it) to get them to work, I'll be fixing this in the future!
    The locale name must match the internal file you are overriding (ie: locale_en_US.properties)
    Locale will first check for a users locale file, if it doesn't exist it will use internal resources (files inside the JAR)
    If a locale is found, it will use locale entries from that file, if any entries are missing, it will use entries from en_US inside the JAR
    The locale file names are structured like this 'locale_XX_XX.properties', replace XX with your country codes, if you are not overriding en_US you will have to change the targetted locale inside config.yml

Version 2.1.50
    Fixed a bug where early game XP boost (level 1-5) didn't function in certain circumstances
    Updated German locale (thanks OverCrave)
    Added missing Herbalism XP values for: Bamboo, Cornflower, Lily of the valley, Wither rose (thanks Zed-I)
    Added missing Mining XP values for: Stone Bricks, Cracked Stone Bricks, Mossy Stone Bricks, Chiseled Stone Bricks, Prismarine Bricks, Dark Prismarine, Sea Lantern (thanks Zed-I)
    Added missing Combat XP multiplier for: Wandering Trader (thanks Zed-I)

    Notes:
    If you haven't upgraded mcMMO since version 2.1.47 or before you will not need to do these steps as the experience file will update once automatically.
    You can either delete experience.yml to generate a new one or edit it manually
    This is what the default experience.yml looks like
    https://paste.gg/p/anonymous/946f62ce7dff4ab7a87cae70c0266313


Version 2.1.49
    Added sweet berry bush to Herbalism XP (Update your experience.yml config or delete it to gen a new one)
    Fixed a bug where falling blocks were not marked as unnatural in water
    Fixed a bug where tool lower notifications were being called async when they are sync only
    Fixed NPE when checking inventory location
    Improved herbalism compatibility with anti-cheat (thanks LogGits)

    NOTE: This is what the default herbalism XP table looks like
    https://paste.gg/p/anonymous/1022088f20cf44298870930e9bc58e8a

Version 2.1.48
    1.14 Support
    Added Cats, Foxes, and Pandas to Taming XP rewards
    Added Cats, Foxes, Pandas, Trader Llamas, Pillagers, and Ravagers to Combat XP rewards
    "Experience" section of experience.yml has been renamed to "Experience_Values"
    Dodge now gives 800 XP
    Roll now gives 600 XP
    Fall now gives 600 XP

    The first 5/50 levels of skills now give large amounts of XP so players get key early skills much faster
        Note: First 5 in Standard, first 50 in Retro

    Dev Notes:
    I will be making a write up soon explaining near future plans for mcMMO and what is going on with the config update, abstraction update, etc...
    Currently this version of mcMMO will work on both 1.13 and 1.14, in the abstraction update I will expand compatible versions of mcMMO to include: 1.14 / 1.13.2 / 1.12.2 / 1.8.8 / Sponge 1.14
    It is not necessary to update your configs if you are upgrading from 1.13 -> 1.14, however if you had custom XP values in your experience.yml you will want to update your config.
    Acrobatics XP was buffed since many AFK counter-measures were put into place to prevent repetitive grinding.
    Experience node in experience.yml was renamed to "automatically" update configs for the new stuff 1.14
    There are 4 updates planned for mcMMO, including a patreon rewards update, a large content update, a config update, and backwards compatibility for 1.13/1.12/1.8.8 and support for Sponge

Version 2.1.47
    Fix NPE when party leader is offline and players grab a party list

Version 2.1.46
    Party member lists now show the whole party, including offline players again.
    Party lists now have special markers for players who are in shared XP range
    Party lists now have special markers for players who are offline
    Party lists now have special markers for the party leader
    Fixed an error where bleed was setting health outside minimum values
    [See NOTE] Fixed a bug where Creepers and Zombies were not dropping the correct heads from Shake (thanks Zed-I)
    [See NOTE] Fixed a bug where salvage was not returning the correct amount of materials for AXE items (thanks Zed-I)
    [See NOTE] Added missing STRIPPED_WOOD entries to experience.yml for Woodcutting
    [See NOTE] Added about 15-20 missing entries to experience.yml for coral to Herbalism
    Fixed a bug where admin chat from console would fail to send (thanks OverCrave)
    Reduced default XP values for DEAD_* coral plants from 30 -> 10
    Updated hu_HU locale (thanks andris155)

    NOTE: These bugfixes were related to default config values, to receive these changes you can either delete experience.yml, treasures.yml and salvage.vanilla.yml to generate new ones or make the necessary edits.
    This is what the files should look like after being edited.
    Experience Correct Default Config - https://paste.gg/p/anonymous/ff695df1417e4232957a3d176fd14ed4
    Salvage Correct Default Config - https://paste.gg/p/anonymous/c4eb2f4e66ed444e872021051760f3be
    Treasures Correct Default Config - https://paste.gg/p/anonymous/b0120210f8c149958ca0303c68c19ebd

Version 2.1.45
    mcMMO will now check to see if the server version is incompatible and inform server admins on how to fix the problem.

Version 2.1.44
    Fixed a NPE with Alchemy brewing

Version 2.1.43
    Fixed a bug that would result in players being told they they failed to salvage enchantments when in reality they succeeded.

Version 2.1.42
    Fixed McMMOPlayerNotFoundException being thrown instead of null
    (API) UserManager.getPlayer() returns null again (oopsie)
    Added new perk permission node `mcmmo.perks.bypass.salvageenchant` - guarantees full enchantment return for Salvage
    Added alternative permission node `mcmmo.perks.bypass.repairenchant` - guarantees full enchantment return for Repair
    Added new wildcard perk `mcmmo.perks.bypass.*` and `mcmmo.perks.bypass.all` (either of these will grant all new mcmmo.perks.bypass perk permissions)

    NOTE: Sorry about that, when trying to improve Bungee Cord compatibility I made a big oopsie!
    NOTE: Repair's new perk permission works in the exact same way as mcmmo.bypass.arcanebypass, bypass perk permissions will all eventually be moved to `mcmmo.perks.bypass`
    NOTE: Expect perk permissions to all be moved to `mcmmo.perks.X` in the near future

Version 2.1.41
    Fixed NullPointerException errors when trying to grab PlayerProfiles for players who have not loaded
    Added new locale string Profile.PendingLoad
    Added new locale string Commands.Database.CooldownMS
    Fixed a display error preventing the remaining time on /mcrank from being shown if it was on cooldown

Version 2.1.40
    (API) mcMMO will now return null in all cases for UserManager.getPlayerProfile() if they have not been loaded yet
    (API) Roll stores exploit data in AcrobaticsManager now
    Added new locale string "Profile.Loading.FailureNotice"
    Added new locale string "Profile.Loading.FailurePlayer"
    mcMMO no longer gives up forever if a player profile fails to load and the player is still online
    mcMMO will attempt to save a profile up to 10 times now, previously it would only try one time.
    Fixed an ArrayIndexOutOfBounds error with Party Chat
    Player data for mcMMO is now loaded 3 seconds after a player connects in order to give any ongoing save tasks from other servers a small grace period to finish. This will mostly be useful to Bungee servers.

NOTES: I received reports from some users saying that saving and loading was failing could fail and not recover, I have implemented some fail safes to greatly reduce the the odds of that happening.

Version 2.1.39
    Salvaging an item should now only play the item break sound (was playing the anvil sound simultaneously before)
    Fixed bug where Tall_Grass was not giving full XP
    Added Tall_Seagrass and Seagrass to experience.yml under Herbalism (update your configs)

    NOTE: This is what your herbalism section in experience.yml should look like - https://paste.gg/p/anonymous/d5b03bd56e8442f2836f8a954d2974de
Version 2.1.38
    Roll XP cooldown down from 60 seconds to 10
    Updated pt_BR localization (thanks FabioZumbi12)
    NOTE: The XP Cooldown will be configurable in 2.2 which is nearing the finish line

Version 2.1.37
    Fixed a potential IndexOutOfBoundsException when informing a disconnected player that their Blast Mining was off CD
    Updated hu_HU locale (thanks andris)
    
Version 2.1.36
    Updated German locale (Thanks OverCrave)
    Fixed a bug preventing Villagers from giving combat XP
    The /mcnotify command will now squelch almost all chat messages or action bar notifications sent to the player from mcMMO
    mcMMO will now remind players on an hourly basis that they are are not receiving notifications from mcMMO if they have run the mcnotify command and toggled squelch mode
    Added a new setting to advanced.yml "Feedback.PlayerTips", when set to true this will allow mcMMO to send periodic helpful messages to players, currently this only affects mcnotify reminders.

Version 2.1.35
    Readded the detonator config option

    NOTE: I decided to make the detonator configurable again because 2.2 is some ways off. Sorry for the inconvenience.
    NOTE: Pickaxes are now usable for blast mining, this is in addition to the detonator that you can specify in the config. This will be more configurable in the upcoming 2.2 update.

Version 2.1.34
    Added Llama to taming XP tables
    Added Parrot to taming XP tables
    Pickaxes are now used to activate Blast Mining instead of Flint
    The detonator for Blast Mining is no longer configurable
    Fixed a bug where Blast Mining did not show cooldown length correctly

    NOTE: You'll have to add these entries in yourself, this is what it should look like: https://paste.gg/p/anonymous/aadbcfde3eb3470fb13caebde4065a03
    Alternatively you can delete the experience config file to generate a new one

Version 2.1.33
    Renamed "Skills.Acrobatics.Prevent_AFK_Leveling" to "ExploitFix.Acrobatics"
    ExploitFix.Acrobatics when set to false allows gaining XP in Acrobatics freely with no anti-grind measures
    NOTE: The anti-grinding/exploit stuff is fully configurable in update 2.2 coming soon, this hotfix is to hold you over until that update comes out.

Version 2.1.32
    Completely removed Fireworks from mcMMO because they lag
    Added 'General.AprilFoolsEvent' setting to config.yml to turn off April Fools
    NOTE: April Fools event has been in mcMMO for a long time, I did not write it so I didn't know it spawned fireworks like crazy.

Version 2.1.31
    Fixed a bug where certain SubSkills did not properly send unlock or rank up notifications
    Fixed a bug where unlock notifications would send simultaneously for a specific skill (still happens if mmoedit changes all skill levels on a player at once)
    Fixed a bug where mmoedit triggered notifications for skills already gained
    Fixed NPE with grabbing offline player skill ranks through certain API methods (thanks Ineusia)
    Updated German language locale (thanks OverCrave)

Version 2.1.30
    Fixed double drops behaving oddly
    Double_Drop config table has been renamed to Bonus_Drops, this is to jankily auto-update everyones config
    DoubleDrop config tables now must contain all things that can possibly be doubled, such as the Ore block, the ore itself, etc.
    Added the following items to the Bonus_Drops tables for Mining: Coal, Diamond, Emerald, Glowstone_Dust, Iron_Ingot, Lapis_Lazuli, Nether_Quartz, Redstone, Cobblestone
    Added the following items to the Bonus_Drops tables for Herbalism: Beetroot, Carrot, Cocoa_Beans, Melon_Slice, Potatoe
    Added the following items to the Bonus_Drops tables for Woodcutting: Birch_Wood, Spruce_Wood, Jungle_Wood, Dark_Oak_Wood, Oak_Wood, Acacia_Wood

    NOTE: You don't need to update your configs for this one unless you had custom entries in the Double_Drop tables, the renaming of the key will auto-insert default values and give everyone correct defaults
    NOTE: I'm gonna have to blame Bukkit on this one, several API methods I used are actually unfinished and kind of janky. So I hacked something together to make them work.

Version 2.1.29
    Fixed a bug where double drops and triple drops were not activating

Version 2.1.28
    Fixed a bug where Archery could not gain XP

Version 2.1.27
    Fixed an exploit that allowed players to duplicate torches, and rails

Version 2.1.26
    Added new scaling damage buffs to all existing Combat Skills
    Added a new subskill named Stab to Swords
    Fixed a bug where Berserk was not adding 50% damage to attacks
    Changed how Iron Arm damage is calculated (Rank 1 now effectively gives twice the damage bonus it used to, higher ranks have more damage)

    NOTE: Combat skills will be completely configurable in the upcoming 2.2 update, be patient <3

    New Permissions
            - mcmmo.ability.unarmed.unarmedlimitbreak
            - mcmmo.ability.axes.axeslimitbreak
            - mcmmo.ability.archery.archerylimitbreak
            - mcmmo.ability.swords.swordslimitbreak
            - mcmmo.ability.swords.stab

    Notes:
    The new Limit Break subskills are intended to make Prot IV players less tanky and for you to feel more powerful for having high skill level.
    Limit Break has 10 ranks, each rank gives 1 extra RAW damage, this is damage before reductions from armor and enchantments. The net result is you deal about 50% more damage with an end game skill compared to before.
    With these new changes, most skills can 2 shot normal diamond armor, and it takes about 5 hits to kill someone in Prot IV Diamond Armor.
    I'm not sure everyone will like these changes, the net result is players are a lot easier to kill now, whereas before you could take quite a beating before getting killed.
    I collected several sets of data before making these changes, including damage to player with and without prot 4 diamond armor, damage to those players with and without enchanted weapons, damage with and without leveling your skills, and combinations of the previously mentioned things.

Version 2.1.25
    Shake now has an upper limit of damage (10) - Will be configurable in 2.2 which is coming in the near future
    Rank 1 of Catalysis & Concoctions are now available at level 0 by default (update skillranks.yml or delete it to regen a new one)
    NOTE: The change to shake was to make mcMMO more compatible with plugins that spawn entities with large amounts of HP

Version 2.1.24
    Fixed an exploit where you could clone inventories

Version 2.1.23
    Fixed a bug with Double Drops for Mining (Update your configs instructions below)
    Fixed a 7 year old bug where damage in mcMMO from SkillBs was potentially getting reduced by damage reduction TWICE
    Fixed a bug where killing entities with Rupture would not properly credit you as the killer
    Fixed a bug where Serrated Strikes was applying Rupture twice
    Players will now be ejected from Minecarts if they cast their fishing rod (anti-afk)
    Many nerfs to Rupture, its now much more reasonable and not very useful against Protection IV opponents
    Rupture's strength is now related to your equipped Sword
    Rupture will no longer be applied if the target is blocking, this doesn't prevent existing bleed damage from occurring though.
    Wolf's Rupture has strength equivalent to a Stone Sword
    Only Diamond swords will have bonus rupture damage at Rank 4
    Rupture damage is cut in half for weapons below Diamond in quality, if the weapon is wooden, the damage is cut in half again.
    Swords below Diamond quality will have their tick duration drastically reduced
    Rupture damage is reduced by 25% on players if they are wearing Full Armor (can be any type)
    Note: You'll need to add these entries to your config.yml manually, or wait for the upcoming config update where this will be fixed for you automatically.
    NOTE: Here's what your Double_Drop entries in Config.yml for Mining should look like

    IMPORTANT: Version 2.1.22 which came before this had a similar fix for Herbalism, instructions on how to fix your Herbalism Double Drops can be found here
        https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/official-mcmmo.64348/update?update=269868
    NOTE: Due to the nature of these fixes, Fortune enchants now work with Double/Triple drops

    It no longer requires seeds to replant crops if you are harvesting crops with a hoe (will still consume seeds if you aren't)
    NOTE: You'll need to add these entries to your config.yml manually, or wait for the upcoming config update where this will be fixed for you automatically.
    NOTE: Here's what your Double_Drop entries in Config.yml for Herbalism should look like: https://paste.gg/p/anonymous/8d8db4ac69bd495fa48a7f5190484c5e

Version 2.1.21
    Improved anti-farm/anti-grinding mechanics for Rolling
    When you gain XP from Rolling there is a cooldown period (60~ seconds) for gaining XP again
    This XP cooldown period extends if players are taking fall damage within the cooldown period
        NOTE: Roll already has a few built in measures to prevent XP grinding / abuse, those are still the same.
        NOTE: Rolls still happen in the cooldown period, you just won't gain XP.

Version 2.1.20
Added Hungarian localization (Locale code: hu_HU) (thanks andris155)
Players can now fish in the same spot about 3 times before mcMMO will mark the area as being over-fished (over-fishing is to prevent abuse)
Added a toggle to turn off the fishing exploit detection to experience.yml "ExploitFix.Fishing"
    Note: The new config update is coming soon and will use a different setting, putting this out as a band-aid fix for people that don't like the new fishing exploit prevention stuff
Added a message to warn players that their next fishing attempt will result in over-fishing (Locale: Fishing.LowResources)

Version 2.1.19
    Greatly Improved Fishing AFK/Exploit Detection
    Fixed a bug where Fishing AFK detection did not work on a new exploit
    Certain exploits for Fishing now result in players losing small amounts of hunger and durability
    Players who get detected by Fishing's anti-exploit measures will no longer get vanilla rewards from Minecraft
        **Note: Previously if mcMMO detected you abusing Fishing it just switched you over to vanilla Minecraft fishing rewards, this change is to help server admins who don't want players to get any kind of reward from AFK fishing
    Fishing now drops several hints to players if they are triggering the exploit detection
        **Note: Not all types of exploit detection will warn players, this is just to prevent legitimate fishers from being confused by the aggressive exploit detection.
    Added messages to warn players about fishing in the same spot (Locale: Fishing.Scarcity)
    Added messages to warn players who exploit in order to catch fish unusually fast (Locale: Fishing.Scared)
    Added messages to warn players about casting the fishing rod too often (Locale: Fishing.Exhausting)

Version 2.1.18
    You will need to add Kelp to your experience.yml file for this fix to be fully functional
    Breaking Kelp will now properly count its XP
    Added "Kelp" to experience.yml (Kelp is actually made up of two blocks mixed together)
    It is recommended that Kelp and Kelp_Plant have the same XP value in experience.yml
    mcMMO will now calculate XP for plants that are taller than naturally allowed (Cactus above 3 block height, etc)

Version 2.1.17
    Fixed a logic error that resulted in Drowned giving no XP
    Fixed a bug that resulted in mob spawner entities to not be marked for no xp after being transforming into Drowned

Version 2.1.16
    Breaking Kelp should now count the whole plant for XP
    Spawned Mobs that are not supposed to award XP will no longer reward XP once transformed (ie: drowned)

Version 2.1.15
    Fixed a bug where a max rank of Fuel Efficiency would cause its benefits to be lost

Version 2.1.14
    Added a config option to toggle double drops for Silk Touch pickaxes (advanced.yml "Skills.Mining.DoubleDrops.SilkTouch"
    Mycelium removed from Woodcutting XP tables (because its soil!)
    Kelp added to Herbalism XP tables
    mcMMO now flags blocks moved by piston as not natural to prevent automated XP farms

    Added spam detection for Unarmed's bonus damage and disarm
