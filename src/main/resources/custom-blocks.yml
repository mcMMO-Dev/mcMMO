# Custom Blocks Configuration
# =============================================================================
# This file stores XP values for custom blocks registered by third-party plugins
# like Oraxen, ItemsAdder, etc.
#
# HOW IT WORKS:
# When a plugin registers a custom block for the first time, an entry will be
# automatically created here with the default values provided by the plugin.
# You can then customize the XP values, change the skill, or disable specific
# blocks entirely.
#
# FORMAT:
#   pluginname:
#     blockid:
#       skill: MINING       # The mcMMO skill (MINING, WOODCUTTING, EXCAVATION, HERBALISM)
#       xp: 100             # XP awarded when breaking this block
#       enabled: true       # Set to false to disable XP for this block
#
# EXAMPLE:
#   oraxen:
#     mythril_ore:
#       skill: MINING
#       xp: 150
#       enabled: true
#     custom_log:
#       skill: WOODCUTTING
#       xp: 80
#       enabled: true
#
# NOTES:
# - Plugin entries are created automatically when plugins register blocks
# - Your customizations are preserved when plugins update their defaults
# - Set 'enabled: false' to completely disable XP for a specific block
# - Valid skills: MINING, WOODCUTTING, EXCAVATION, HERBALISM
