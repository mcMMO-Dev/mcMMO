  thought out and is constantly being improved upon. Currently, mcMMO adds thirteen
  unique skills to train and level in. Each of these skills is highly customizable
  through our configuration files, allowing server admins to tweak mcMMO to best suit
  the needs of his or her server. Know that the mcMMO team is dedicated to providing
  an ever-evolving experience, and that we carefully read all feedback and bug reports
  in order to evaluate and balance the mechanics of mcMMO in every update.
