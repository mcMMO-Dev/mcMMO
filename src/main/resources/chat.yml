# CUSTOMIZATION INFORMATION
# If you want to customize the look and feel of chat channels, that is handled through localization which is configurable
# You can find information on how to handle that in the link below
# https://mcmmo.org/wiki/Locale
# When editing the locale for chat, do a search in the master text file (your local locale override file is empty at first, read the wiki article above) for "chat" and that should lead you right to the locale entries related to chat
