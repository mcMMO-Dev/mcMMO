Experience_Formula:
    # Valid values are: LINEAR and EXPONENTIAL
    # If an invalid value is entered, this will reset to the default setting, which is LINEAR
    # LINEAR:      base + (level * multiplier)
    # EXPONENTIAL: multiplier * level ^ exponent + base
    Curve: LINEAR

    # If invalid values are entered mcMMO will use the default values instead and print an error in the console

    # Experience gained will get divided by these values. 1.0 by default, 2.0 means two times lower
