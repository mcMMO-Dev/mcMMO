# mcMMO
## The RPG lovers mod

### Dev builds
Our latest development builds are available [here](http://ci.mcmmo.info).

### Brief Description
mcMMO takes core Minecraft game mechanics and expands them to add an extensive RPG experience, the goal of the project has always been a quality RPG experience. Everything in mcMMO is carefully thought out and is constantly improving. mcMMO adds eleven skills to train in and level in, while also offering a high level of customization for server admins. There are countless features, including custom sounds, graphical elements, and more added when running mcMMO in conjunction with Spout. I carefully read feedback and evaluate the mechanics of mcMMO in every update to provide an ever-evolving experience.

If you want an original RPG experience like no other mod out there, mcMMO is for you.
