== mcMMO
**The RPG lovers mod**

=== Brief Description
mcMMO takes core Minecraft game mechanics and expands them to add an extensive RPG experience, the goal of the project has always been a quality RPG experience. Everything in mcMMO is carefully thought out and is constantly improving. mcMMO adds eleven skills to train in and level in, while also offering a high level of customization for server admins. There are countless features, including custom sounds, graphical elements, and more added when running mcMMO in conjunction with Spout. I carefully read feedback and evaluate the mechanics of mcMMO in every update to provide an ever-evolving experience.

If you want an original RPG experience like no other mod out there, mcMMO is for you.

=== About the Developer
I've always wanted to make games and in the last year I decided to take a swing at developing Minecraft mods as a platform to teach myself programming, the biggest project I have made to date is mcMMO. I went from knowing nothing about Java to what I know now purely from modding Minecraft, and I plan to move onto game development in the not so distant future.

I take design very seriously, I am not the kind of person who can be satisfied giving a project anything less than my all. As you will see reflected in the quality of the mods I make, I take great care in my work.

Hearing that people enjoy mcMMO and seeing the daily youtube videos about my mod has become a joy, I really can't believe how popular my mod has gotten!
